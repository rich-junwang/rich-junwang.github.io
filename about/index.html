<p>Hi there, this is Jun Wang. welcome to my website. I'm a programmer. I love programming. I want to use technology to
    make the world better.
    I'm a strong believer that it's easier to invent the future than to predict it.</p>


<p>In my life, I like hiking a lot. I'm also very much into reading books of history, biography etc. Drop me a line if
    you want to chat more! </p>
