Hi there, this is Jun Wang, I'm an programmer, welcome to my website. I love programming, but my academic training
is more about hardware design. I hope to use technology to make world better. It's easier to invent the future
than to predict it.

In my life, I like hiking a lot. I'm also very much into reading books of history, biography etc. Hope me a line if you
want to chat more!
