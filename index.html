	<p>I'm an Applied Scientist at Amazon. My research focuses on machine learning and its applications in natural language processing. I aim to design systems that understand natural language in a way that makes sense to humans. Generally, Iâ€™m interested in areas such as semantic parsing, question answering and knowledge representation learning and reasoning, language grounding, and methods insipred by cognative science. <p>
