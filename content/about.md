<p>Hi there, this is Jun Wang. Welcome to my website. I'm a programmer. I love programming. I want to use technology to
    make the world better. I'm a strong believer that it's easier to invent the future than to predict it.
    
Currently, I'm an Applied Scientist at Amazon. My research focuses on LLMs, foundational model training, machine learning and its applications in
natural language processing. I aim to design systems that understand natural language in a way that makes
sense to humans. Generally, I’m interested in areas such as semantic parsing, question answering and
knowledge representation learning and reasoning, language grounding, and methods insipred by cognitive
science.
</p>
<p>Opinions are my own and I do not speak for my employer or my team. On this webpage, I'd like to share my study and my
paper reading. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any comments/suggestions</p>

<p>In my spare time, I like hiking a lot. I'm also very much into reading books of history, biography etc. Drop me a line if
    you want to chat more! </p>
