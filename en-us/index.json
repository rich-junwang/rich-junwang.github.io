The answer is yes, however, coarse-grained design (giving less flexibility for model to learn the pattern) usually leads to worse performance.\nDynamic Routing There are a couple of ways to design router to route tokens to each expert. Ideally, we want to design a router that could make each expert specialize one of domains/tasks. Obviously there is no straightforward way to achieve this. In Mixtral, softmax-topk based gating mechanism is used to select experts.\nFor any input $x$ of dimension $[\\text{sequence\\_len}, \\text{dim}]$, it multiplies with a gate matrix $W$ of shape $[\\text{dim}, 8]$, then we get a router representation of shape $[\\text{sequence\\_len}, 8]$. It selects top k (num of experts per token) logits which then go through softmax op to normalize to get k experts weights. In Mixtral, the k is equal to 2.\nLoad Balancing For dynamic routing, which token is routed to which expert is unknown upfront, so there exists the load balancing issue. Common solution is to add an load balancing loss.\nTraining Directly training MoE could be challenging due to low efficiency.

Among these, hallucination is one of the most seen issues. In other words, the generations from LLMs are not grounded. To this end, people are turning to retrieval augmented generation to tackle the issue. In this blog, let’s roll up our sleeves and dive deep into the retrieval augmented system.\nRAG system contains: chunking, indexing, querying and generation. Chunking and indexing both are the offline processes which is the crucial data modeling phase. Querying and generation are online processes.\nRAG system for QA, image from [1] Indexing Retrieval Retrieval is the online process where the system converts user query into vector representation and retrieve relevant documents.\nRetrieval Evaluation Metric Like recommender system, retrieval system commonly use the following evaluation metrics.\nHit ratio (hit@k), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), Precision@k, Recall@k Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) Mean Average Precision (MAP) Hit@k Hit@k sometimes is also called Top-k accuracy. It is the percentage of search queries for each of which at least one item from the ground truth is returned within the top-k results. Simply put, it means % of queries get answer hit at top k retrieved passages. (Answer hit means user clicked on the doc). This number is meaningful when there are multiple test cases.\nNDCG Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) is popular method for measuring the quality of a set of search results. It asserts the following:\nVery relevant results are more useful than somewhat relevant results which are more useful than irrelevant results (cumulative gain) Relevant results are more useful when they appear earlier in the set of results (discounting). The result of the ranking should be irrelevant to the query performed (normalization). Cumulative Gain (CG) is the predecessor of DCG and does not include the position of a result in the consideration of the usefulness of a result set. In this way, it is the sum of the graded relevance values of all results in a search result list. Suppose you were presented with a set of search results for a query and asked to rank each result. Given a true relevance score $R_i$ (real value) for every item, there exist several ways to define a gain. One of the most popular is: $$ G_i = 2^{R_i} - 1 $$\nwhere $i$ is the rank position/index of the item. The relevance score can be defined by ourselves, for instance, we can say: 0 =\u0026gt; Not relevant 1 =\u0026gt; Near relevant 2 =\u0026gt; Relevant. In practical use case, it\u0026rsquo;s defined as a binary value 0 and 1 where 0 is irrelevant and 1 is there is relevance.\nThe cumulative gain is then defined as: $$ CG@k = \\sum_{i=1}^k G_i $$\nTo achieve the Discounted cumulative gain (DCG) we must discount results that appear lower. The premise of DCG is that highly relevant documents appearing lower in a search result list should be penalized as the graded relevance value is reduced logarithmically proportional to the position of the result. Thus $DCG$ is: $$ DCG@k = \\sum_{i=1}^k\\frac{2^{R_i} - 1}{log_2{(i + 1)}} $$\nAs DCG either goes up with $k$ or it stays the same, the queries that return larger result sets will always have higher DCG scores than queries that return small result sets. To make comparison across queries fairer is we want to normalize the DCG score by the maximum possible DCG for different $k$. $$ NDCG@k = \\frac{DCG@k}{IDCG@k} $$ where $IDCG@k$ is the best $DCG$ we can get at position $k$.\nPrecision@k and Recall@k Precision@k measures the percentage of relevant results among top k results. At the same time, recall@k evaluates the ratio of relevant results among top k to the total number of relevant items in the whole dataset. $$ Precision@k = \\frac{\\text{number of recommended relevant items among top k}}{\\text{number of recommended items k}} $$ $$ Recall@k = \\frac{\\text{number of recommended relevant items among top k}}{\\text{number of all relevant items in the system}} $$\nMRR MRR measures “Where is the first relevant item?”. Given a query and a list of returned items, we find the rank (position $p_i$) of the first relevant items. We take the inverse of the rank to get the so-called reciprocal rank. For mean reciprocal rank, we just take average of reciprocal rank for all queries.\nMRR MRR Pros\nThis method is simple to compute and is easy to interpret. This method puts a high focus on the first relevant element of the list. It is best suited for targeted searches such as users asking for the “best item for me”. Good for known-item search such as navigational queries or looking for a fact. MRR Cons\nThe MRR metric does not evaluate the rest of the list of recommended items. It focuses on a single item from the list. It gives a list with a single relevant item just a much weight as a list with many relevant items. It is fine if that is the target of the evaluation. This might not be a good evaluation metric for users that want a list of related items to browse. The goal of the users might be to compare multiple related items. MAP The P@N decision support metric calculates the fraction of n recommendations that are good. The drawback of this metric is that it does not consider the recommended list as an ordered list. Precision@k considers the whole list as a set of items, and treats all the errors in the recommended list equally. The goal is to cut the error in the first few elements rather than much later in the list. For this, we need a metric that weights the errors accordingly. The goal is to weight heavily the errors at the top of the list. Then gradually decrease the significance of the errors as we go down the lower items in a list. The Average Prediction (AP) metric tries to approximate this weighting sliding scale.\nAverage Precision (AP) is a metric about how a single sorted prediction compares with the ground truth. i.e., AP tells how correct a single ranking of documents is, with respect to a single query. Thus, MAP is meaningful when there are multiple test cases.\nAP is calculated as the average of precision@k over the list.\nMAP TREC_EVAL TREC_EVAL is an evaluation tool which is used to evaluate an Information Retrieval system. TREC_EVAL requires two files: one is qrels (query relevance) and the other is retrieval output that needs to be evaluated.\ntrec_eval [-q] [-a] trec_rel_file trec_top_file Where trec_eval is the executable name for the code, -q is a parameter specifying detail for all queries, -a is a parameter specifying summary output only (-a and –q are mutually exclusive), trec_rel_file is the qrels, trec_top_file is the results file.\nThe qrels file\nThis file contains a list of documents considered relevants for each query. This relevance judgement is made by human beings who manually select documents that should be retrieved when a particular query is executed. This file can be considered as the \u0026ldquo;correct answer\u0026rdquo; and the documents retrieved by your IR system should approximate the maximum to it. It has the following format:\nquery-id 0 document-id relevance\nThe field query-id is a alphanumeric sequence to identify the query, document-id is a alphanumeric sequence to identify the judged document and the field relevance is a number to indicate the relevance degree between the document and query (0 for non relevant and 1 for relevant). The second field \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo; is not currently used, just put it in the file. The fields can be separated by a blank space or tabulation.\nThe results file\nThe results file contains a ranking of documents for each query automaticaly generated by your application. This is the file that will evaluated by trec_eval based in the \u0026ldquo;correct answer\u0026rdquo; provided by the first file. This file has the following format:\nquery-id Q0 document-id rank score STANDARD\nThe field query-id is a alphanumeric sequence to identify the query. The second field, with \u0026ldquo;Q0\u0026rdquo; value, is currently ignored by trec_eval, just put it in the file. The field document-id is a alphanumeric sequence to identify the retrieved document. The field rank is an integer value which represents the document position in the ranking, but this field is also ignored by trec_eval. The field score can be an integer or float value to indicate the similarity degree between document and query, so the most relevants docs will have higher scores. The last field, with \u0026ldquo;STANDARD\u0026rdquo; value, is used only to identify this run (this name is also showed in the output), you can use any alphanumeric sequence.\nRetrieval Fusion The straightforward idea in the era is dense retrieval is that we could combine sparse retrieval and dense retrieval together. A common approach is to use reciprocal rank fusion. The RRF score of document $d$ is: $$ RRF_d = \\sum_r^R{\\frac{1}{c + r(d)}} $$ assuming there are $R$ ranking items and $r(d)$ is the rank of document $d$. Here $c$ is a constant.\nRRF, image from [4] Generation References [1] Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey [2] Evaluation Metrics for Ranking problems: Introduction and Examples [3] Reciprocal Rank Fusion outperforms Condorcet and individual Rank Learning Methods [4] Advanced RAG Techniques: an Illustrated Overview\n","permalink":"https://rich-junwang.github.io/en-us/posts/tech/rag/","summary":"LLMs has made remarkable progress these days, however, they still exhibit notable limitations.

Sampling-based methods are extensively used in practice becaue of its ease of use and the generality where they can be applied. One of the fundamental problems is to calculate the expectation of a random variable, which can be expressed as\n$$ \\mathbb{E_{x\\sim p(x)}}\\left(f(x)\\right) = \\int{f(x)p(x)} dx $$ when it\u0026rsquo;s a continuous random variable with a probability density function of $p$, or $$ \\mathbb{E}\\left(f(x)\\right) = \\sum_x{f(x)p(x)} $$ when it\u0026rsquo;s a discrete random variable with probability mass function of $p$. Then the Monte Carlo approximation says that the expectation is: $$ \\mathbb{E}\\left(f(x)\\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{f(x_i)} $$\nassuming that the $x_i$ here is the i.i.d samples from the distribution $p(x)$.\nImportance Sampling In reality, it could be very challenging to sample data according to the distribution $p(x)$ as it is usually unknown to us. A workaround is to have another known distribution $q(x)$, and define the expectation as: $$ \\mathbb{E_{x\\sim p(x)}}[f] = \\int{q(x)\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}f(x)} dx $$ This can be seen as the expectation of function $\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}f(x)$ according to the distribution of $q(x)$. The distribution is sometimes called the proposal distribution. Then the expectation can be estimated as $$ \\mathbb{E_{x\\sim q(x)}}[f] \\approx \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\\frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)}f(x_i)} $$ Here the ratios $\\frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)}$ are referred sa the importance weights. The above derivation looks nice. However, we need to notice that the although the expectation is similar in both cases, the variance is different:\n$$ Var_{x\\sim p(x)}[f] = \\mathbb{E_{x\\sim p(x)}}[f(x)^2] - ({\\mathbb{E_{x\\sim p(x)}}[f(x)]})^2 $$\n$$ \\begin{aligned} Var_{x\\sim q(x)}[f] \u0026amp;= \\mathbb{E_{x\\sim q(x)}}[({\\frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)}f(x_i)})^2] - (\\mathbb{E_{x\\sim q(x)}}[{\\frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)}f(x_i)}])^2 \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\mathbb{E_{x\\sim p(x)}}[{\\frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)}f(x_i)^2}] - (\\mathbb{E_{x\\sim p(x)}}[f(x_i)])^2 \\end{aligned} $$ Notice that the second equation here, in the second step derivation, the expectation is relative to distribution of $p(x)$. From the above two equations, we can see that to make the sampling distribution as close as possible to the original distribution, the ratio $\\frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)}$ has to be close to 1.\nPolicy Gradient First, let\u0026rsquo;s remind ourselves some basics. The discounted return for a trajectory is defined as: $$ U_t = R_t + \\gamma R_{t+1} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+2} + \\gamma^3 R_{t+3} + \u0026hellip; $$\nConsequently, the action-value function is defined as $$ Q_{\\pi}(s_t, a_t) = \\mathbb{E_t}[U_t|S_t=s_t, A_t=a_t] $$\nState-value function can be calculated as: $$ V_{\\pi}(s_t) = \\mathbb{E_A}[Q_{\\pi}(s_t, A)] = \\sum_a \\pi(a|s_t) \\cdot Q_{\\pi}(s_t, a) $$\nIn policy gradient algorithm, the policy function $\\pi(a|s_t)$ is approximated by policy network $\\pi(a|s_t; \\theta)$. $\\theta$ here is the neural network model parameters. Then the policy-based learning is to maximize the objective function $$ \\begin{aligned} J(\\theta) \u0026amp;= \\mathbb{E_S}[V(S; \\theta)] \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\sum_{s\\in S} d_{\\pi}(s) V_{\\pi}(s_t; \\theta) \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\sum_{s\\in S} d_{\\pi}(s) \\sum_a \\pi(a|s_t; \\theta) \\cdot Q_{\\pi}(s_t, a) \\end{aligned} $$\nwhere $d_{\\pi}(s)$ is the stationary distribution of Markov chain for $\\pi_{\\theta}$, namely the state distribution under policy $\\pi$. Now we know the objective function of the policy-based algorithm, we can learn the parameters $\\theta$ through policy gradiet ascent.\nNow we can look at how to get the policy gradient. Since the first summation of the last step in the above equation has nothing to do with $\\theta$, so we can focus on getting the derivatives of the value function $V_{\\pi}(s; \\theta)$. Using chain rule, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get: $$ \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial{V(s; \\theta)}}{\\partial{\\theta}} \u0026amp;= \\sum_a \\frac{\\partial{\\pi (a|s; \\theta)}}{\\partial{\\theta}} \\cdot Q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\sum_a \\pi(a|s_t; \\theta) \\frac{\\partial{\\log\\pi (a|s; \\theta)}}{\\partial{\\theta}} \\cdot Q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\mathbb{E_A}\\left[ \\frac{\\partial{\\log\\pi (a|s; \\theta)}}{\\partial{\\theta}} \\cdot Q_{\\pi}(s, a) \\right] \\end{aligned} $$ The last step assumes that $\\frac{\\partial{\\log\\pi (a|s; \\theta)}}{\\partial{\\theta}} \\cdot Q_{\\pi}(s, a)$ follows a distribution of $\\pi(a|s_t; \\theta)$ with respect to the random variable $A$.\nThe above equation is the vanilla policy gradient method. More policy gradient algorithms are proposed later to reduce high variance of the vanilla version. John Schulman\u0026rsquo;s GAE paper summarized all the improvement methods. In the derivation, the policy gradient is represented as $$ \\frac{\\partial{V(s; \\theta)}}{\\partial{\\theta}} = \\mathbb{E_A}\\left[ \\frac{\\partial{\\log\\pi (a|s; \\theta)}}{\\partial{\\theta}} \\cdot \\hat{A_t}(s, a) \\right] $$ where $\\hat{A_t}(s, a)$ is the advantage function. In implementation, we construct loss function in a way such that the policy gradient $g$ equals to the above result $$ L(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E_t}\\left[ \\log\\pi (a|s; \\theta) \\hat{A_t}(s, a) \\right] $$\nActor-Critic Algorithm There we give a recap of how actor-critic method works. In Actor-Critic algorithm, we use one neural network $\\pi(a|s; \\theta)$ to approximate policy function $\\pi(a|s)$ and use another neural network $q(s, a; w)$ to approximate value function $Q_{\\pi}(s, a)$.\nObserve state $s_t$, and randomly sample action from policy $a_t \\sim \\pi(\\cdot | s_t; \\Theta_t)$ Let agent perform action $a_t$, and get new state $s_{t+1}$ and reward $r_t$ from environment Randomly sample $\\tilde{a}_{t+1} \\sim \\pi(\\cdot | s_t; \\Theta_t)$ without performing the action Evaluate value network: $q_t = q(s_t, a_t; W_t)$ and $q_{t+1} = q(s_{t+1}, \\tilde{a}_{t+1}; W_t)$ Compute TD error: $\\delta_t = q_t - (r_t + \\gamma \\cdot q_{t+1})$ Differentiate value network: $d_{w,t} = \\frac{\\partial{q(s_t, a_t, w)}}{\\partial{w}}$ (autograd will do this for us) Update value network: $ w_{t+1} = w_t - \\alpha \\cdot \\delta_t \\cdot d_{w, t}$ Differentiate policy network: $ d_{\\theta, t} = \\frac{\\partial{\\log\\pi (a|s; \\theta)}}{\\partial{\\theta}} $ (again autograd will do this for us) Update policy network: $\\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_t + \\beta \\cdot q_t \\cdot d_{\\theta, t}$. We can also use: $\\theta_{t+1} = \\theta_t + \\beta \\cdot \\delta_t \\cdot d_{\\theta, t}$ to update policy network. This is called policy gradient with baseline. Essentially, the algorithm alternates between sampling and optimization. The expectation in the above equation indicates that we need to average over a finite batch of empirical samples. Proximal Policy Optimization Vanilla policy gradient method uses on-policy update. Concretely, the algorithm samples empirical data from a policy network $\\pi_{\\theta}$ parameterized with $\\theta$. After updating the network itself, the new policy network is $\\pi_{\\theta_{new}}$ and the old policy $\\pi_{\\theta}$ is out of use and future sampling will be from $\\pi_{\\theta_{new}}$. This whole process is not efficient enough. The solution to this is to reuse the old samples to achieve off-policy training. From above importance sampling section, we know that:\n$$ \\mathbb{E_{x\\sim p(x)}}\\left[f \\right] = \\mathbb{E_{x\\sim q(x)}} \\left[ \\frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)}f(x_i) \\right] $$\nSimilarly, we can make a change to the objective function of our policy gradient, and the resulting policy gradient will become $$ \\begin{aligned} g \u0026amp;= \\mathbb{E_{{(s_t, a_t)} \\sim \\pi_{\\theta}}}\\left[ \\frac{\\partial{\\log\\pi (a_t|s_t; \\theta)}}{\\partial{\\theta}} \\cdot \\hat{A_t}(s, a) \\right] \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\mathbb{E_{{(s_t, a_t)} \\sim \\pi_{\\theta_{old}}}}\\left[ \\frac{\\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t; \\theta)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)} \\frac{\\partial{\\log\\pi (a_t|s_t; \\theta)}}{\\partial{\\theta}} \\cdot \\hat{A_t}(s, a) \\right] \\end{aligned} $$ Consequently, the loss becomes\n$$ L(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E_{{(s_t, a_t)} \\sim \\pi_{\\theta_{old}}}}\\left[ \\frac{\\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)} \\hat{A_t}(s, a) \\right] $$ This is so-called surrogate objective function. In the above section, we mentioned how to use chain rule to get the expectation format of gradient, here we just to reverse the process to get the above loss function.\nIn the importance sampling section, we saw that the variance of new distribution could be large when the proposal distribution is not so close to the original distribution. Thus, to deal with this, people add KL diveragence to the loss function to limit the old and new policy difference. Using Largrangian dual method, we can add this constraint to the objective function:\n$$ L(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E_{{(s_t, a_t)} \\sim \\pi_{\\theta_{old}}}}\\left[ \\frac{\\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)} \\hat{A_t}(s, a) - \\beta KL[\\pi_{\\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t), \\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t)]\\right] $$\nImplementation For language generation task, generating a token is an action. Agent is the target language model we want to train.\nHere we first look at the implementation from Deepspeed-chat model. The actor-critic algorithm requires to load four model in training: actor model, critic model, reference model and reward mdoel. Actor model is the poliy network and critice model is the value network. Reference model and reward model are frozen in training. Reference model is used to contrain the actor model predictions so that they won\u0026rsquo;t divege too much.

We can see that there are three types of memory affect GPU computation. CPU memory (data loading etc), GPU high bandwidth memory (the gpu memory we usually mentioned), and GPU caches (SRAM). These memories are of different size and bandwidth (read speed). The idea of flash attention is to design IO-aware fused computation kernel to save memory access to speed up training job.\nFigure 1. GPU memory Figure 2 shows a more detailed hierarchy of GPU memory in A100. Notice that cache is specific to each compute unit.\nFigure 2. GPU memory hierarchy IO-aware Computation First let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the vallina attention computation which is shown below\nFigure 3. Vallina attention computation Essentially, each of the operation follows the three steps of operation below.\nRead op — Move tensor from HBM to SRAM Compute op - Perform compute intensive task on SRAM write op - move tensor back from SRAM to HBM The breakdown of these computation is as follows. Apparently, all these green ops in the vallina attention can be saved.\nFigure 4. Vallina attention computation break down However, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to put giant attention matrix of size [N x N] in the cache. The idea to solve this challenge is to use tiling. Concretely, we slice the matrices into smaller blocks and in each of Q K computation, we do it in a small block scale. The output of the small block thus can be saved on the cache. This sounds perfectly except that softmax op is not possible with small block computation. Lucklily there are already some studies dealing with this [1-2]. Before talking about this, let\u0026rsquo;s first revisit stable softmax computation.\nBlockwise Softmax Underflow in numerical computation can cause precision issue. Overflow can be more problematic because it usually leads to divergence of training job (some may argue silent error is more detrimental :)). Softmax operation involves exponential computation which without careful handling can easily lead to overflow (such as exp(2000)).\n$$ \\text{softmax}(x)_i = \\frac{e^{x_i - \\max(x)}}{\\sum_j e^{x_j - \\max(x)}} $$\nSimilary, the cross entropy can be computed as\n$$ \\begin{aligned} H(p, q) \u0026amp;= -\\sum_i p_i\\log(q_i) \\\\ \u0026amp;= -1\\cdot\\log(q_y) -\\sum_{i \\neq y} 0\\cdot\\log(q_i) \\\\ \u0026amp;= -\\log(q_y) \\\\ \u0026amp;= -\\log(\\text{softmax}(\\hat{y})_y) \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\log(\\text{softmax}(x)_i) \u0026amp;= \\log(\\frac{e^{x_i - \\max(x)}}{\\sum_j e^{x_j - \\max(x)}}) \\\\ \u0026amp;= x_i - \\max(x) - \\log(\\sum_j e^{x_j - \\max(x)}) \\end{aligned} $$\nBy simply extracting the max value, we limit the exponential values to be in [0, 1]. In Flashattention paper, the softmax is represented as follows:\nFigure 5. Softmax Then blockwise softmax can be computed as follows:\nFigure 6. Blockwise Softmax With saving some summary (i.e. max) statistics, the softmax op can be decomposed into blocks.\nRecomputation in Backpropagation With the fused kernel, we effectively do the computation outside Pytorch computation graph. Thus, we can\u0026rsquo;t use the AutoGrad for gradient computation in backpropagation. Consequently, we have to define the backpropagation by ourselves. The way to solve this is very simple as well. We just define our own backpropagation ops for fused kernel like gradient checkpointing.\nReferences [1] SELF-ATTENTION DOES NOT NEED O(n^2) MEMORY [2] Online normalizer calculation for softmax [3] FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n","permalink":"https://rich-junwang.github.io/en-us/posts/tech/flash_attn/","summary":"In order to understand how flash attention and its variants help improve compute efficiency of modern LLMs training, we first have to dive deep into GPU compute model and its memory hierarchy.

The way to collect the dataset is as follows:\nselect some contract labeler collect human written prompt-answer pairs. Prompts are either from GPT3 API or from human annotation. collect a dataset of human-labeled comparisons between outputs from our models on a larger set of API prompts. The following diagram from the paper demonstrated how these steps unfold during the training.\nIn summary, there are three steps:\nUse labeled data to fine-tune GPT3 model Train a reward model Use RL to optimize GPT3 parameters In the first step, we got data from annotators and use this data to fine-tune GPT3 model. In the second step, they prepare some questions and GPT3 model gives multiple predictions for each question and annotators are asked to rank the generated predictions. This data is used to train reward model. The reward model is used for prediction and predict which one is most close to human choice. Reward model gives a score and the closer to human choice, the higher of the score.\nFinally, use policy-based RM algorithm to do further optimization. The whole process is shown in the diagram below. It uses reward mechanism to train model. The reward can be seen as the loss function in traditional ML training. Reward function is much more versatile than loss function (Think about DotaRL and AlphaGo). The consequence is that reward function may not be differentiable, thus can\u0026rsquo;t be used for back-propagation. People can sample rewards to proximate this loss function.\nRL algorithm. Image from [4] PPO From the repo in [4], the three steps of PPO are as follows:\nRollout: The language model generates a response or continuation based on query which could be the start of a sentence. Evaluation: The query and response are evaluated with a function, model, human feedback or some combination of them. The important thing is that this process should yield a scalar value for each query/response pair. Optimization: In the optimisation step the query/response pairs are used to calculate the log-probabilities of the tokens in the sequences. This is done with the model that is trained and and a reference model, which is usually the pre-trained model before fine-tuning. The KL-divergence between the two outputs is used as an additional reward signal to make sure the generated responses don\u0026rsquo;t deviate to far from the reference language model. The active language model is then trained with PPO.

In this section, we will focus exclusively on memory-mapped files, where the memory of region corresponds to a traditional file on disk. For example, assume that the address 0xf77b5000 is mapped to the first byte of a file. Then 0xf77b5001 maps to the second byte, 0xf77b5002 to the third, and so on.\nWhen we say that the file is mapped to a particular region in memory, we mean that the process sets up a pointer to the beginning of that region. The process can the dereference that pointer for direct access to the contents of the file. Specifically, there is no need to use standard file access functions, such as read(), write(), or fseek(). Rather, the file can be accessed as if it has already been read into memory as an array of bytes. Memory-mapped files have several uses and advantages over traditional file access functions:\nMemory-mapped files allow for multiple processes to share read-only access to a common file. As a straightforward example, the C standard library (glibc.so) is mapped into all processes running C programs. As such, only one copy of the file needs to be loaded into physical memory, even if there are thousands of programs running. In some cases, memory-mapped files simplify the logic of a program by using memory-mapped I/O. Rather than using fseek() multiple times to jump to random file locations, the data can be accessed directly by using an index into an array. Memory-mapped files provide more efficient access for initial reads. When read() is used to access a file, the file contents are first copied from disk into the kernel’s buffer cache. Then, the data must be copied again into the process’s user-mode memory for access. Memory-mapped files bypass the buffer cache, and the data is copied directly into the user-mode portion of memory. If the region is set up to be writable, memory-mapped files provide extremely fast IPC data exchange. That is, when one process writes to the region, that data is immediately accessible by the other process without having to invoke a system call. Note that setting up the regions in both processes is an expensive operation in terms of execution time; however, once the region is set up, data is exchanged immediately. In contrast to message-passing forms of IPC (such as pipes), memory-mapped files create persistent IPC. Once the data is written to the shared region, it can be repeatedly accessed by other processes. Moreover, the data will eventually be written back to the file on disk for long-term storage. mmap file ","permalink":"https://rich-junwang.github.io/en-us/posts/tech/distributed_training/data_processing/","summary":"A memory mapping is a region of the process’s virtual memory space that is mapped in a one-to-one correspondence with another entity.

People tend to underestimate efforts needed to train a good large model like GPT3 etc. Most people imagine that they can get decent language models given enough computation resources. The fact is even today only OpenAI is providing LM APIs where people can freely play with and get good performances. In this blog, we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about pretraining from the whole pipeline: data sourcing, collection and processing, tokenization, architecture engineering and evaluation. Hopefully, it would be helpful for foundational model training practitioners.\nData Data is crucial in any ML system. This is true to pretraining as well. As is shown in Gopher paper, a large, diverse and high-quality dataset is needed to train a good model. In the following table, it shows the datasets used in Gopher model training. Now we\u0026rsquo;re looking at terabytes scale of training data.\nDatasets used in Gopher [2] An ensuing problem with large amount of data is that data quality is hard to control. In practice, we have to at least make sure the content should be intelligible. We might want to give more training on high-quality datasets such as books and wikipedia [31]. Diversified datasets are necessary but can't guarantee training success as can be seen from `Gopher` paper, model performs well on QA related tasks but suffers on reasoning task. What else is needed? We'll come back to this later. Toxicity Filter There is experiment shows that toxicity filter could have a big impact on model performance. In [37], the authors proposed that instead of using a toxicity filter, inverse toxicity filtering is more helpful. Inverse toxicity filter removes the LEAST toxicity data from training data.\nTokenizer Language models compute probability of any string sequence. How to represent the string sequence is determined by tokenizer. Popular options are byte pair encoding (BPE) or wordpiece. As the majority of models are using BPE today, here we focus on BPE based tokenizer. Tokenizer can impact several things in LLM training: (1) a high compression rate (tokenized token number vs raw token number, the lower the better). Compression rate affects input context length and inference speed. (2) Vocab size. An appropriately sized vocabulary to ensure adequate training of each word embedding.\nAs mentioned in GPT2 paper, BPE effectively interpolates between word level inputs for frequent symbol sequences and character level inputs for infrequent symbol sequences. Directly using greedy method to build BPE merging rules can be problematic. For example, word cat can be used in a lot of places like cat?, cat!, cat.. One way to solve this issue is to prevent BPE from generating rules across different character categories (letters, digits, puncts etc).\nAs people are pivoting in-context learning/instruction learning with large models, tokenization efficiency becomes more important. The following tables from Jurassic-1 paper shows the efficiency of tokenizer on several public dataset.\nTokenizer efficiency comparison from [16] Tokenizer determines the size of vocab. Usually when we support multilinguality and code data, the vocab size will be much larger. However, this is not always the case. CodeLLaMa shows very good performance (onpar with GPT4) with a vocab size of 32k. When vocab is too large, some of the tokens may not be trained enough. When vocab size is too small, the compression rate might be limited.\nCompression rate determines the input sequence length to the model. With high compression rate, the input length is shorter. Short sequence length might be able to mitigate exposure bias to some extent.\nOpen tokenizer implementations are: tiktoken.\nModel Architecture All pretrained models are variant of original transformer model. The differences are mainly about it\u0026rsquo;s encoder-decoder architecture or decoder-only architecture. First of all, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the choices of available large models.\nModels Model Size Token Size Architecture GPT3 175B 300B Decoder OPT 175B 300B Decoder PaLM 540B 780B Decoder Gopher 280B 300B Decoder Chinchilla 70B 1400B Decoder Jurassic-1 178B - Decoder Megatron-Turing NLG 530B 270B Decoder LaMDA 137B 2810B Decoder Although all models listed here are auto-regressive decoder only model, they actually differ a bit inside the decoder. For instance, to speed up inference time, PaLM is using multi-query attention. Normally, in multi-head attention, there will be h heads each with a linear project layer for Q, K, V. With multiquery attention, instead of using h different linear project layers for K and V, we can share a single smaller linear project layer for K and a single linear projection layer for V for each head. Then, for different head layers, K and V will be the same. In this way, we can save memory IO and get better latency performance in incremental inference. To speed up training, people also proposed parallel layer architecture as shown below.\nModel Architecture A systematic study of transformer architecture is done in Ref [29]. Most of recent LLM architecture are following design from this paper. People usually call the embedding dim as the width of transformer and number of layers as the depth. There is a optimal depth-to-width allocation for a given self-attention network size as is shown in [34].\nTraining Design Most of today\u0026rsquo;s pretraining follow suits of a multi-stage and multi-task training. As is shown by Yao in [1], GPT series model is pretrained in such way as well.\nGPT Model Lineage. Image from [1] From the lineage diagram, we can see that ChatGPT model comes from Codex model which can be seen as a different stage of training. The way of scheduling tasks and data during training can have great impact on the final model performance.\nBatch Size Research [5] shows that there is a critical batch size in pretraining. When training batch size exceeds critical batch size, model performance starts to degrade. Critical batch size is independent of model size and is related to loss.\nGenerally small batch size leads to better validation loss when training with the same number of tokens as more random movement of gradient explores more of loss landscape. Often times, small batch size gives better generalization performance as well as pointed out in [27]. The reason given from the paper is that smaller batch size usually converges to flat minimum as oppose to sharp minimum. Intuitively, this is related to graident update in each step is small for large batch size training.\nFlat and Sharp Minima [27] Learning Rate Scheduling Usually as pointed out in [20], when we scale up batch size, we increase learning rate propotionally. However, when we increase model size (usually followed with batch size increase), the training tends to be more unstable. Thus, in reality, we decrease maximum learning rate when we increase model size (batch size).\nLearning rate scheduling usually involves a (linear) warm-up step to maximum learning rate and followed by a decaying step to 0 or a minimum learning rate. Currently, there are several methods in literature for the decaying step:\nLinear scheduler Plateau-linear schedule Cosine scheduler Regularization One of the most used regularization method is L2 regularization, aka, weight decay [28]. For instance, GPT 3 training uses a weight decay of 0.1. Note that comparing with traditional neural network tuning weight decay number (such as 0.01) GPT3 weight decay is pretty large.\nLength Extrapolation As in-context learning becomes popular, people are asking a question, Can an LLM maintain equally good, if not better, perplexities when longer sequences are used during inference time? This is the so-called length extrapolation [25].\nOptimizer When we select an optimizer, we have to take consideration of memory footprint and stability issues etc. Options are Adafactor, Adam etc. According to Gopher paper, adafactor optimizer has smaller memory footprint, and on smaller scale model (\u0026lt;7B) adafactor works well. However, when model size goes larger, performance suffers because of stability issue.\nEvaluation A lot of large models come out every year and many claims that they could beat GPT3 model in a wide range of benchmarks like SuperGlue, CLUE, MMLU etc. However, when you do benchmark these models in zero-shot setting or some less common tasks (but still very reasonable ones), these models tend to perform really bad. I personally tested GPT3 model (175b) and UL2 model (20b) on text2sql and sql2text task, GPT3 gives way better performance to the extent that you\u0026rsquo;ll believe UL2 is like garbage. The similar thing happened in evaluation in [24]. You may argue that the model size differs a lot. However, we can think the other way around: the results they claim better than GPT3 is also got from a smaller model and maybe their model training is not easy/efficient to scale to such level. Essentially, what I want to say is that good performance on popular benchmark datasets doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean much for large LM pretraining as this is highly related to source of training data, whether or not doing fine-tuning, proper prompting etc. Human evaluation is what really matters.\nStability During the model training, the most commonly seen issue is gradient exploding, aka, gradient becomes NaN. As layers go deeper, this problem happens more often because the way backpropagation works. Over the years, people have proposed many different ways to solve the challenge. As is shown in paper [21], the post-LN shows stability issue without carefully designed warming-up stage. As a result, they are proposing pre-LN to alleviate the problem.\nThe objective function for highly nonlinear deep neural networks often contains sharp nonlinearities in parameter space resulting from the multiplication of several parameters. These nonlinearities give rise to very high derivatives in some places. When the parameters get close to such a cliff region, a gradient descent update can catapult the parameters very far, possibly losing most of the optimization work that had been done [33].\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to monitor stability during training. Common practice is to plot activation norm and gradient norm for each step. When these values spike, we know there is something wrong. It\u0026rsquo;s better than looking at loss curve only as loss explosion generally lags behind these two indicators. For instance, when there is bad data, we could have better gauge of when that happens and restart training from that point.\nAdept AI has a lengthy blog post talking about hardware error induced stability issue. The blog mentioned two ways to identify erroneous node(s):\nGrid search: partition nodes into groups and train model on each group in a deterministic way. Find the one that has different training loss curve. Parameter checksum check: for each data parallel run, check parameter checksum to see if they are the same to determine which stage might be wrong. PaLM paper proposed adding z-loss to increase the stability of training. The method is to encourage the logits to stay close to zero. For example, we could add a max-z loss to normalize the logits: $$ L_{max\\_z} = 2e^{-4} * z^2 $$ where $z$ is the maximum logit value [39].\nEfficient Inference Inference speed determines product cost. Over the years, people have proposed various ways to improve inference speed. The multiquery attention mentioned above is one of these approaches. References [1] How does GPT Obtain its Ability?

Rule element labels instead provides an alternative way to access the content parsed by the sub-rule to which the label is assigned.\n(2) For the following grammar, both item nad clause will be parsed as a list in the parsing tree.

With model size and training data at such scale, computation resource and memory footprint requirement is huge. How to effectively leverage GPU resources to speed up training is an important topic in language model pretraining. In this blog, we\u0026rsquo;ll dive deep into parallel training in recent distributed training paradigms.\nA lot of contents of here are from OpenAI, Nvidia, Deepspeed and bigscience blogs. We\u0026rsquo;ll first go through different parallelism techniques and then talk about how to combine them to maximize training efficiency.\nData Parallelism Data parallelism (DP) is the most straightforward way of parallel training. With data parallelism, model parameters and optimzer states are replicated across different workers. Data is partitioned into the same number of shards and each replicate of model is fed with one shard of data. Forward and backward computation is in parallel (simutaneously) and then there is a synchronization step where gradients are averaged across workers to update parameters. The DP computation can be summarized as the following three steps:\nEach machine computes local gradients given local inputs and a consistent global view of the parameters. LocalGrad_i = f(Inputs_i, Targets_i, Params) Sum up all the local gradients and distribute that sum to each machine, so there is a consistent global view of the gradients. GlobalGrad = all_reduce(LocalGrad_i) Each machine can now locally update the parameters and optimizer state under the assumption that the exact same calculation will happen on all machines. NewParams, NewOptimState = g(Params, OldOptimState, GlobalGrad) Pipeline Parallelism Pipeline parallelism (PP) is from model parallelism. Model parallelism is initially proposed to solve that challenge that one model can\u0026rsquo;t fit into one GPU. The idea is we can vertically slice model into different layers (e.g. one or more layers in transformer models) and put different layers in different GPUs. The issue with this method is that because sequential computation order of layers, if we feed single large batch data into one of the workers, all other workers are idle. This is the so-called bubble waiting time.\nTo solve the problem, we can reuse the data parallelism idea. Instead of feeding a single large batch into a model shard, we can partition data into small chunks. Each chunk of data goes through different model shards (workers) in a pipeline way. The following figure illustrates how this works.\nPipeline parallelism. image from [4] Tensor Parallelism The bottleneck of neural network training is compute. Among all the computation parts, the general matrix multiplication (GEMM) consumes the most of time. One way to parallize the matrix multiplication is to use matrix decomposition. Specifically, we can split a matrix into two or multiple parts based on row or column. Then we can aggregate results after the computation of each parts in the end. This is the core idea of tensor parallelism (TP).\nIn it\u0026rsquo;s essence, tensor parallelism is block matrix mutiplication. Based on how we partition the parameter matrix, there is row parallel partition and column parallel partition. For row parallel partition, there is\n$$ Y = XW = \\begin{bmatrix} X_1, \u0026amp; X_2\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} W_1 \\\\ W_2\\end{bmatrix} = X_1W_1 + X_2W_2 $$\nFor column parallel partition, there is $$ Y = XW = X\\begin{bmatrix} W_1, \u0026amp; W_2\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} XW_1, \u0026amp; XW_2\\end{bmatrix} $$ Note that for row parallel, we need to partition the input into two parts as well. In original transformer MLP layer, there are two projection steps: hidden.size -\u0026gt; 4 * hidden.size -\u0026gt; hidden.size. In this case, in Megatron-LM MLP implementation, it first does column parallel partition, generating two matrices, then a row parallel partition. This is shown in the following figure:\nTensor Parallelism in Megatron-LM As these three parallelism is orthogonal to each other, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to combine them together. The following diagram shows how to combine pipeline parallelism with data parallelism.\nCombination of pipeline parallelism and data parallelism. Image from Deepspeed tutorial ZeRO DP Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) is an optimizied data parallelism proposed by Deepspeed team. The idea is instead of replicating the whole model, optimizer on each of workers, we can only store needed part.\nZero DP. Image from Deepspeed Parallelism in Megatron Megatron-LM and NeMo are the open source libraries from Nvidia for the distributed training. In these two libs, there are two constraints for the parallelism settings.\n- world_size = TP * PP * DP - global_batch_size % (PP * DP) == 0 Sequence Parallel For operations such as layer normation, the operation can be paralleized on the sequence dimension. Remember that layernorm is normalization over the feature dimenstion, ie. a token representation of 2048 will be normalized over 2048 numbers. In light of this, sequence parallel is proposed to reduce GPU memory consumption.\nSequence parallelism Implementation A few key points in 3D parallelism implementation.\nTP is communication heavy, thus TP blocks should be put on different GPUs within the same node to leverage fast NVLink communication. On the contrary, PP communication is light, and it is usually put across nodes. Within a data parallel group, all GPUs hold the same model parameters. After each update, there will be gradient all-reduce operation. How to achieve this, in Megatron-LM, this is achieved by first partition all GPUs by pipeline parallelism. Then withnin the same pipeline block, partition GPUs based on tensor parallelism. After that, the number of copies within the pipeline block will be the data parallelism number.\nTraining Efficiency Metric A simpler metric for evaluation of training efficiency is model FLOPs utilization (MFU) which is defined as the ratio of the observed throughput to the theoretical maximum throughput with peak FLOPs. As can be seen in the definition, it\u0026rsquo;s very hardware dependent metric. For A100 GPUs, the metric can be calculated as $$ MFU_{V100} = \\frac{{num\\_of\\_parameters} * 6 * {total\\_training\\_token\\_count}}{{num\\_of\\_gpus} * 312e^{12} * {training\\_days} * 24 * 3600 } $$\nGenerally a good MFU should be above 40%.\nReferences [1] https://huggingface.co/blog/bloom-megatron-deepspeed [2] https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo [3] https://openai.com/blog/techniques-for-training-large-neural-networks/ [4] GPipe: Efficient Training of Giant Neural Networks using Pipeline Parallelism [5] Megatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model Parallelism [6] https://www.deepspeed.ai/tutorials/pipeline/ [7] MegaScale: Scaling Large Language Model Training to More Than 10,000 GPUs [8] AMSP: Reducing Communication Overhead of ZeRO for Efficient LLM Training [9] Reducing Activation Recomputation in Large Transformer Models\n","permalink":"https://rich-junwang.github.io/en-us/posts/tech/parallelism/","summary":"Modern large language model usually is trained with billions number of parameters and trillions number of tokens.

In gradient accumulation, N batches go through the forward path and backward path, and each time, the gradient is computed and accumulated (usually summed or averaged), but model parameters are not updated. Model parameters are updated after iterate through all N batches. The logic is as follows:\nfor step, oneBatch in enumerate(dataloader): ... ypred = model(oneBatch) loss = loss_func(ytrue, ypred) loss.backward() # release all activations memory if step % accumulation_step == 0: # update weights every accumulation_step steps loss.step() loss.zero_grad() In order to backpropagate, all the hidden activations must be stored until we call loss.backward(). In contrast, if we only add losses together (accumulating losses), all the activation memory won\u0026rsquo;t be released, so we can\u0026rsquo;t save memory.\nInstall Apex Sometimes to use the latest distributed training feature, we have to install Apex.

Pytorch and Numpy Advanced Indexing When selection object is sequence object, ndarray/tensor, it will trigger advanced indexing. To understand how it works, we start from simple.\nx = np.arange(12).reshape(4,3) print(x) #output [[ 0 1 2] [ 3 4 5] [ 6 7 8] [ 9 10 11]] (1) Specify integer arrays in each dimension where every element in the array represents a number of indices into that dimension. In the example below, we select (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0) elements from the above array. x has two dimensions so we have two arrays to specify the indices in each dimension.\ny = x[[0,1,2], [0,1,0]] print(y) #[0 4 6] (2) The above way of indexing only renders single dimension result. We can use multi-dimension array to get multi-dimension output. Below is one of these examples. This is to select [(0, 0), (0, 2)], [(3, 0), (3, 2)] elements. Note that in each dimension we still only select one index, like 0 from row-dim, and 0 from col-dim.\nrows = np.array([[0,0],[3,3]]) cols = np.array([[0,2],[0,2]]) y = x[rows,cols] print (y) # output [[ 0 2] [ 9 11]] Loading a pretrained checkpoint A lot of times when we save a checkpoint of a pretrained model, we also save the trainer (or model state) information. This means when we load model checkpoint again, model will already have a preallocated device. When we use the same number of GPU to continue training, it will work as expected. However, the issue will arise when we have different number of GPUs for two runs. Let\u0026rsquo;s say, we first trained model on a single GPU, then we want to use multiple GPU to continue the training. When we move model to multiple GPU, there will be something weird. For instance, on GPU 0, you might see multiple process (normally one process per GPU). Or in other cases, you can see GPU 0 has much higher memory usage than other GPUs.\nSolution: when we load model, we only load parameters and strip all state information. This might be tricky sometimes. The simplest way to solve this issue is to wrap the command with with PyTorch distributed data parallel.\npython3 -m torch.distributed.launch --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=8 my_script.py my_config_file ","permalink":"https://rich-junwang.github.io/en-us/posts/tech/pytorch/pytorch/","summary":"Using PyTorch for NN model training on single GPU is simple and easy.

I don\u0026rsquo;t work on infrastructure side, but I run into the concepts a lot, so I create this blog to help me understand more about infrastructure.\nMost of today\u0026rsquo;s distributed framework involves three parts, collective communication, data loading and preprocessing and distributed scheduler. We\u0026rsquo;ll look into these three parts respectively.\nDistributed System Overview In the diagram below, I\u0026rsquo;m showing the modern distributed network communication implementation stack, from the bottom hardware to top level application.\nTraining system architecture Collective Communication We can start with point to point communication. Normally point to point communication refers to two processes communication and it\u0026rsquo;s one to one communication. Accordingly, collective communication refers to 1 to many or many to many communication. In distributed system, there are large amount of communications among the nodes.\nThere are some common communication ops, such as Broadcast, Reduce, Allreduce, Scatter, Gather, Allgather etc.\nBroadcast and Scatter Broadcast is to distribute data from one node to other nodes. Scatter is to distribute a portion of data to different nodes.\nMPI broadcast and scatter Gather Gather is an inverse operation of scatter.\nMPI gather Reduce and Allreduce Reduce is a collections of ops. Specifically, the operator will process an array from each process and get reduced number of elements.\nMPI reduce MPI reduce Allreduce means that the reduce operation will be conducted throughout all nodes. An all_reduce takes in a local array on each machine and returns the sum of all the arrays on every machine. Here we show flat all reduce operation below. However, the most common algorithm for doing this is a variant of the “ring allreduce”,\nMPI Allreduce The ReduceScatter operation performs the same operation as Reduce, except that the result is scattered in equal-sized blocks between ranks, each rank getting a chunk of data based on its rank index. In the figure below, each rank provides an array in of N (also called N element buffer, 4 here) values,\nMPI ReduceScatter Note: Executing ReduceScatter, followed by AllGather, is equivalent to the AllReduce operation.\nDifference between All2All and All_gather The following figure shows the difference between MPI all2all and all_gather.\nMPI all2all and all_gather Mixed Precision Training Normally, during training we use single precision (32-bit floats). However, for LLM pretraining, this requires high-bandwidth computing platform. To address this challenge, people proposed mixed precision training. As the name suggested, mixed precision training is to leverage mixed different data type during training process, e.g. fp32 and fp16 or fp32 and bf16. We train model mostly in half precision and leave some critical ops in fp32. ss\nMixed precision training (image from fastai) Since it has same range as FP32, BF16 mixed precision training skips the scaling steps. All other Mixed Precision steps remain the same as FP16 Mixed Precision. We leave the batchnorm layers in single precision (they don’t have many weights so it’s not a big memory challenge) and compute the loss in single precision (which means converting the last output of the model in single precision before passing it to the loss). The training loop is as follows:\ncompute the output with the FP16 model, then the loss back-propagate the gradients in half-precision. copy the gradients in FP32 precision do the update on the master model (in FP32 precision) copy the master model in the FP16 model.

I don\u0026rsquo;t work on infrastructure side, but I run into the concepts a lot, so I create this blog to help me understand more about infrastructure. Most of today\u0026rsquo;s distributed framework involves three parts, collective communication, data loading and preprocessing and distributed scheduler. We\u0026rsquo;ll look into these three parts respectively. Distributed System Overview In the diagram below, I\u0026rsquo;m showing the modern distributed network communication implementation stack, from the bottom hardware to top level application. Training system architecture Collective Communication We can start with point to point communication. Normally point to point communication refers to two processes communication and it\u0026rsquo;s one to one communication. Accordingly, collective communication refers to 1 to many or many to many communication. In distributed system, there are large amount of communications among the nodes.

Others may question your credentials, your papers, your degrees. Others may look for all kinds of ways to diminish your worth. But what is inside you no one can take from you or tarnish. This is your worth, who you really are, your degree that can go with you wherever you go, that you bring with you the moment you come into a room, that can\u0026rsquo;t be manipulated or shaken. Without that sense of self, no amount of paper, no pedigree, and no credentials can make you legit. No matter what, you have to feel legit inside first. Walk that walk and go forward all the time. Don\u0026rsquo;t just talk that talk, walk it and go forward. Also, the walk didn\u0026rsquo;t have to be long strides; baby steps counted too. Go forward. You got a dream\u0026hellip; You gotta protect it. People can\u0026rsquo;t do somethin' themselves, they wanna tell you you can\u0026rsquo;t do it. If you want somethin\u0026rsquo;, go get it. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry if your tasks are small and rewards are few, remember that the mighty oak was once a nut like you. When you know this world as it is and you still love it, then your life will be beautiful. What is a success: To laugh often and much, to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children, to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends, to appreciate beauty, to find the best in others, to leave the world a bit better\u0026hellip; A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step! Adversity is a catalyst for greatness! Winners worry about winning; losers worry about winners Slow is smooth and smooth is fast Success is not final, failure is not fatal, it is the courage to continue that counts. Doublethink, to deliberately believe in lies, while knowing they\u0026rsquo;re false. Examples of this in everyday life: \u0026ldquo;Oh, I need to be pretty to be happy. I need surgery to be pretty. I need to be thin, famous, fashionable.\u0026rdquo; Our young men today are being told that women are whores, bitches, things to be screwed, beaten, shit on, and shamed. This is a marketing holocaust. Twenty-four hours a day for the rest of our lives, the powers that be are hard at work dumbing us to death. So to defend ourselves, and fight against assimilating this dullness into our thought processes, we must learn to read. To stimulate our own imagination, to cultivate our own consciousness, our own belief systems. We all need skills to defend, to preserve our own minds. (Detachment) Part II 不迁怒，不贰过: 回年二十九，发尽白，蚤死。孔子哭之恸，曰：“自吾有回，门人益亲。” 鲁哀公问：“弟子孰为好学？”孔子对曰：“有颜回者好学，不迁怒，不贰过。不幸短命死矣，今也则亡，未闻好学者 也。”\n爱好和付出是一个正反馈的过程\n人生惟有常是第一美德 （曾国藩）\n兄自问近年得力惟一悔字诀。兄昔年自负本领甚大，可屈可伸，可行可藏，又每见得人家不是。自从丁已、戊午大悔大悟之后，乃知自己全无本领，凡事都见得人家有几分是处。故自成午 至今九载，与四十岁以前迥不相同，大约以能立能达为体，以不怨不尤为用。立者，发奋自强，站得住也； 达者，办事圆融，行得通也。（曾国藩）\n孔子曰：君子有九思：视思明，听思聪，色思温，貌思恭，言思忠，事思敬，疑思问，忿思难，见得思义。孔子说：君子有九种考虑：看的时候，考虑看明白了没有；听的时候，考虑听清楚了没有；考虑自己的表情温和么？态度庄重么？说话诚恳老实么？工作严肃认真么？遇到疑难，考虑怎样去 向人家请教；要发怒了，考虑有没有后患；在可以得到利益的时候，考虑是不是该得。\n凡遇牢骚欲发之时，则反躬自思，吾果有何不足，而蓄此不平之气，猛然内省，决然去之。（曾国藩）\n怕什么真理无穷，进一寸有一寸的欢喜.\n他强由他强，清风拂山岗，他横任他横，明月照大江。\n颜渊问仁。子曰：克己复礼，为仁。一日克己复礼，天下归仁焉。为仁由己，而由人乎哉？颜渊曰：请问其目。子曰：非礼勿视，非礼勿听，非礼勿言，非礼勿动。颜渊曰：回虽不敏，请 事斯语矣。\n君子不忧不惧。\n士不可以不弘毅，任重而道远，仁以为己任，不亦重乎，死而后已，不亦远乎。\n为天地立心，为生民立命，为往圣继绝学，为万世开太平。\n修身齐家治国平天下。\n一切众生皆具如来智慧德相，唯以妄想执着不能证得.\n成功不是终结，失败不是终结，唯有勇气才是永恒 (Winston Churchill)\n","permalink":"https://rich-junwang.github.io/en-us/posts/read/quotes/","summary":"Frequently, I would turn to these quotes as a source of inspiration, using them to encourage personal growth for both my mind and soul.

A lower value of momentum means that older values are forgotten sooner.

It works perfectly when development dependencies are simple and easy to set up. Generally I refer this development mode as local development. However, as more and more development environments are containerized, it becomes non-trivial to set up environment everytime. Recently, I started using VSCode as it has better support to leverage remote server development environment.\nOne great feature of VScode is that it works well with docker and kubernetes, i.e. we can attach VSCode to docker or kubernetes pods easily. In vscode terminal, we can execute commands like we\u0026rsquo;re doing on the server. I call this kind of development as remote development.\nOne problem with remote development is that we can\u0026rsquo;t save our changes locally. Once server dies, all our changes are gone. The solution is to use git. Since docker doesn\u0026rsquo;t come with an editor, when we use git, we have to set vscode as the editor:\ngit config --global core.editor \u0026#34;code --wait\u0026#34; Another issue is we have to install extensions on remote server. For instance, we have to install python extension in order to use python interpreter in remote mode.\nVScode also has a nice extension tool to sync code to remote server.\nVScode Shortcuts If it\u0026rsquo;s on Mac, replace CTRL key with CMD key\n(1) CTRL + X : cut a line (2) duplicate a line: duplicate can be achieved by CTRL+C and CTRL+V with cursor in the line (without selection)\n(3) edit multiple line\nedit multiple line simultaneously: CTRL + SHIFT + up/down arrow.

It works perfectly when development dependencies are simple and easy to set up. Generally I refer this development mode as local development. However, as more and more development environments are containerized, it becomes non-trivial to set up environment everytime. Recently, I started using VSCode as it has better support to leverage remote server development environment. One great feature of VScode is that it works well with docker and kubernetes, i.e. we can attach VSCode to docker or kubernetes pods easily. In vscode terminal, we can execute commands like we\u0026rsquo;re doing on the server. I call this kind of development as remote development.

What is the reason why we say that negative log likehood and cross entropy is equivalent.\nWhen normalization function (we can say activation function of last layer) is softmax function, namely, for each class $s_i$ the probability is given by $$ f(s)_i = \\frac{e^{s_i}}{ \\sum_j ^{C} e^{s_j}} $$ Given the above cross entropy equation, and there is only one positive class, the softmax cross entropy loss is: $$ L = -log(\\frac{e^{s_p}}{ \\sum_j ^{C} e^{s_j}}) $$ here $p$ stands for positive class. If we want to get the gradient of loss with respect to the logits ($s_i$ here), for positive class we can have $$ \\frac{\\partial{L}}{\\partial{s_p}} = \\left(\\frac{e^{s_p}}{ \\sum_j ^{C} e^{s_j}} - 1 \\right) \\\\ \\frac{\\partial{L}}{\\partial{s_n}} = \\left(\\frac{e^{s_n}}{ \\sum_j ^{C} e^{s_j}} - 1 \\right) $$ We can put this in one equation, which is what we commonly see as the graident of cross entropy loss for softmax $$ \\frac{\\partial{L}}{\\partial{s_i}} = p_i - y_i $$ $p_i$ is the probability and $y_i$ is the label, 1 for positive class and 0 for negative class.\nBinary Cross Entropy In the above section, we talked about softmax cross entropy loss, here we talk about binary cross entropy loss which is also called Sigmoid cross entropy loss.\nWe apply sigmoid function to the output logits before BCE. Notice that here we apply the function to each element in the tensor, all the elements are not related to each other, this is why BCE is widely used for multi-label classification task.\nFor each label, we can calculate the loss in the same way as the logistic regression loss.\nimport torch import numpy as np pred = np.array([[-0.4089, -1.2471, 0.5907], [-0.4897, -0.8267, -0.7349], [0.5241, -0.1246, -0.4751]]) # after sigmod, pred becomes # [[0.3992, 0.2232, 0.6435], # [0.3800, 0,3044, 0.3241], # [0.6281, 0.4689, 0.3834]] label = np.array([[0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1]]) # after cross entropy, pred becomes # [[-0.5095, -1.4997, -0.4408], take neg and avg 0.8167 # [-0.4780, -0.3630, -1.1267], take neg and avg 0.6559 # [-0.4651, -0.6328, -0.9587]] take neg and avg 0.6855 # 0 * ln0.3992 + (1-0) * ln(1-0.3992) = -0.5095 # (0.8167 + 0.6559 + 0.6855) / 3. = 0.7194 pred = torch.from_numpy(pred).float() label = torch.from_numpy(label).float() crition1 = torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss() loss1 = crition1(pred, label) print(loss1) # 0.7193 crition2 = torch.nn.MultiLabelSoftMarginLoss() loss2 = crition2(pred, label) print(loss2) # 0.7193 Noise Contrastive Estimation Noise contrastive estimation or negative sampling is a commonly used computation trick in ML to deal with expansive softmax computation or intractable partition function in computation.\nThe derivation of NCE loss sometimes can be bewildering, but the idea is actually very simple. For example, in word2vec implementation, the negative sampling is to choose 1 positive target and 5 negative target, and calculate the binary cross entropy loss (binary logistic loss) and then do backward propagation.\nContrastive Loss CLIP Loss CLIP loss is the same with the paper from [3]. The negatives here are used for contrastive learning. However, they\u0026rsquo;re not using NCE method like word2vec. It\u0026rsquo;s more like softmax cross entropy.\nimport torch from torch import nn import torch.nn.functional as F import config as CFG from modules import ImageEncoder, TextEncoder, ProjectionHead class CLIPModel(nn.Module): def __init__( self, temperature=CFG.temperature, image_embedding=CFG.image_embedding, text_embedding=CFG.text_embedding, ): super().__init__() self.image_encoder = ImageEncoder() self.text_encoder = TextEncoder() self.image_projection = ProjectionHead(embedding_dim=image_embedding) self.text_projection = ProjectionHead(embedding_dim=text_embedding) self.temperature = temperature def forward(self, batch): # Getting Image and Text Features image_features = self.image_encoder(batch[\u0026#34;image\u0026#34;]) text_features = self.text_encoder( input_ids=batch[\u0026#34;input_ids\u0026#34;], attention_mask=batch[\u0026#34;attention_mask\u0026#34;] ) # Getting Image and Text Embeddings (with same dimension) image_embeddings = self.image_projection(image_features) text_embeddings = self.text_projection(text_features) # Calculating the Loss logits = (text_embeddings @ image_embeddings.T) / self.temperature images_similarity = image_embeddings @ image_embeddings.T texts_similarity = text_embeddings @ text_embeddings.T targets = F.softmax( (images_similarity + texts_similarity) / 2 * self.temperature, dim=-1 ) texts_loss = cross_entropy(logits, targets, reduction=\u0026#39;none\u0026#39;) images_loss = cross_entropy(logits.T, targets.T, reduction=\u0026#39;none\u0026#39;) loss = (images_loss + texts_loss) / 2.0 # shape: (batch_size) return loss.mean() def cross_entropy(preds, targets, reduction=\u0026#39;none\u0026#39;): log_softmax = nn.LogSoftmax(dim=-1) loss = (-targets * log_softmax(preds)).sum(1) if reduction == \u0026#34;none\u0026#34;: return loss elif reduction == \u0026#34;mean\u0026#34;: return loss.mean() if __name__ == \u0026#39;__main__\u0026#39;: images = torch.randn(8, 3, 224, 224) input_ids = torch.randint(5, 300, size=(8, 25)) attention_mask = torch.ones(8, 25) batch = { \u0026#39;image\u0026#39;: images, \u0026#39;input_ids\u0026#39;: input_ids, \u0026#39;attention_mask\u0026#39;: attention_mask } CLIP = CLIPModel() loss = CLIP(batch) print(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) Reference Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision http://www.cnblogs.com/peghoty/p/3857839.html contrastive learning of medical visual representations from paired images and text https://github.com/moein-shariatnia/OpenAI-CLIP/blob/master/CLIP.py ","permalink":"https://rich-junwang.github.io/en-us/posts/tech/loss/","summary":"Sigmoid Sigmoid is one of the most used activation functions. $$ \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} $$ It has nice mathematical proprities: $$ \\sigma^\\prime(x) = \\sigma(x) \\left[ 1 - \\sigma(x) \\right] $$ and $$ \\left[log\\sigma(x)\\right]^\\prime = 1 - \\sigma(x) \\\\ \\left[log\\left(1 - \\sigma(x)\\right)\\right]^\\prime = - \\sigma(x) $$ Logistic Regression For a binary classification problem, for an example $x = (x_1, x_2, \\dotsb , x_n)^T$, the hypothesis function (for the positive class) can be written as: $$ \\begin{aligned} h_{\\theta}(1|x) \u0026amp;= \\sigma(\\theta_0 + \\theta_1x_1 + \\theta_2x_2 + \\dotsb + \\theta_nx_n) \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\sigma(\\theta^{\\mathrm{T}}x) \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\theta^{\\mathrm{T}}x}} \\end{aligned} $$ Consequently, for the negative class, $$ \\begin{aligned} h_{\\theta}(0|x) \u0026amp;= 1 - \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\theta^{\\mathrm{T}}x}} \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{1+e^{\\theta^{\\mathrm{T}}x}} \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\sigma(-\\theta^{\\mathrm{T}}x) \\end{aligned} $$ Single sample cost function of logistic regression is expressed as: $$ L(\\theta) = -y_i \\cdot \\log(h_\\theta(x_i)) - (1-y_i) \\cdot \\log(1 - h_\\theta(x_i)) $$ Notice that in","title":"Loss in ML"},{"content":"Git Git merge Suppose we\u0026rsquo;re on master branch, if we want to override the changes in the master branch with feature branch, we can use the following command\ngit merge -X theirs feature to keep the master branch changes:\ngit merge -X ours feature If we want to rebase of current branch onto the master, and want to keep feature branch\ngit rebase master -X theirs if we want to keep master branch changes over our feature branch, the\ngit rebase master -X ours To summarize, we can have the following table:\n\u0026nbsp;

Now we can stage any files we want, commit and push them.\nStep 4 After pushing/committing the first feature pr, we can stash all the remaining changes (so that we won\u0026rsquo;t commit in this branch).\ngit stash --include-untracked --keep-index Step 5 Repeat this process from above to create a second PR.

Thanks to the original author!\nFind Command The original post is here: https://www.baeldung.com/linux/find-exec-command\n1. Basics The find command is comprised of two main parts, the expression and the action. When we initially use find, we usually start with the expression part. This is the part that allows us to specify a filter that defines which files to select.\nA classic example would be:\n$ find Music/ -name *.mp3 -type f Music/Gustav Mahler/01 - Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde.mp3 Music/Gustav Mahler/02 - Der Einsame im Herbst.mp3 The action part in this example is the default action, -print. This action prints the resulting paths with newline characters in between. It’ll run if no other action is specified.\nIn contrast, the -exec action allows us to execute commands on the resulting paths. Let’s say we want to run the file command on the list of mp3 files we just found to determine their filetype. We can achieve this by running the following command:\n$ find Music/ -name *.mp3 -exec file {} \\; Music/Gustav Mahler/01 - Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde.mp3: Audio file with ID3 version 2.4.0, contains:MPEG ADTS, layer III, v1, 128 kbps, 44.1 kHz, Stereo Let’s dissect the arguments passed to the -exec flag, which include: A command: file A placeholder: {} A command delimiter: ; Now we’ll walk through each of these three parts in-depth.\n2. The Command Any command that can be executed by our shell is acceptable here. We should note that this isn’t our shell executing the command, rather we’re using Linux’s exec directly to execute the command. This means that any shell expansion won’t work here, as we don’t have a shell. Another effect is the unavailability of shell functions or aliases.\nAs a workaround for our missing shell functions, we can export them and call bash -c with our requested function on our file. To see this in action, we’ll continue with our directory of Mahler’s mp3 files. Let’s create a shell function that shows the track name and some details about the quality:\nfunction mp3info() { TRACK_NAME=$(basename \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34;) FILE_DATA=$(file \u0026#34;$1\u0026#34; | awk -F, \u0026#39;{$1=$2=$3=$4=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;; print $0 }\u0026#39;) echo \u0026#34;${TRACK_NAME%.mp3} : $FILE_DATA\u0026#34; } If we try to run the mp3info command on all of our files, -exec will complain that it doesn’t know about mp3info:\nfind . -name \u0026#34;*.mp3\u0026#34; -exec mp3info {} \\; find: ‘mp3info’: No such file or directory As mentioned earlier, to fix this, we’ll need to export our shell function and run it as part of a spawned shell:\n$ export -f mp3info $ find . -name \u0026#34;*.mp3\u0026#34; -exec bash -c \u0026#34;mp3info \\\u0026#34;{}\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34; \\; 01 - Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde : 128 kbps 44.1 kHz Stereo 02 - Der Einsame im Herbst : 128 kbps 44.1 kHz Stereo 03 - Von der Jugend : 128 kbps 44.1 kHz Stereo Note that because some of our file names hold spaces, we need to quote the results placeholder.\n3. The Results Placeholder The results placeholder is denoted by two curly braces {}.\nWe can use the placeholder multiple times if necessary:\nfind . -name \u0026#34;*.mp3\u0026#34; -exec bash -c \u0026#34;basename \\\u0026#34;{}\\\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; file \\\u0026#34;{}\\\u0026#34; | awk -F: \u0026#39;{\\$1=\\\u0026#34;\\\u0026#34;; print \\$0 }\u0026#39;\u0026#34; \\; 01 - Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde.mp3 Audio file with ID3 version 2.4.0, contains MPEG ADTS, layer III, v1, 128 kbps, 44.1 kHz, Stereo 02 - Der Einsame im Herbst.mp3 Audio file with ID3 version 2.4.0, contains MPEG ADTS, layer III, v1, 128 kbps, 44.1 kHz, Stereo 03 - Von der Jugend.mp3 Audio file with ID3 version 2.4.0, contains MPEG ADTS, layer III, v1, 128 kbps, 44.1 kHz, Stereo In the above example, we ran both the basename, as well as the file commands. To allow us to concatenate the commands, we spawned a separate shell, as explained above.\n4. The Delimiter We need to provide the find command with a delimiter so it’ll know where our -exec arguments stop. Two types of delimiters can be provided to the -exec argument: the semi-colon(;) or the plus sign (+). As we don’t want our shell to interpret the semi-colon, we need to escape it (;).\nThe delimiter determines the way find handles the expression results. If we use the semi-colon (;), the -exec command will be repeated for each result separately. On the other hand, if we use the plus sign (+), all of the expressions’ results will be concatenated and passed as a whole to the -exec command, which will run only once.\nLet’s see the use of the plus sign with another example:\n$ find . -name \u0026#34;*.mp3\u0026#34; -exec echo {} + ./Gustav Mahler/01 - Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde.mp3 ./Gustav Mahler/02 - Der Einsame im Herbst.mp3 ./Gustav Mahler/03 - Von der Jugend.mp3 ./Gustav Mahler/04 - Von der Schönheit.mp3 ./Gustav Mahler/05 - Der Trunkene im Frühling.mp3 ./Gustav Mahler/06 - Der Abschied.mp3 When running echo, a newline is generated for every echo call, but since we used the plus-delimiter, only a single echo call was made. Let’s compare this result to the semi-colon version:\n$ find . -name \u0026#34;*.mp3\u0026#34; -exec echo {} \\; ./Gustav Mahler/01 - Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde.mp3 ./Gustav Mahler/02 - Der Einsame im Herbst.mp3 From a performance point of view, we usually prefer to use the plus-sign delimiter, as running separate processes for each file can incur a serious penalty in both RAM and processing time.\nHowever, we may prefer using the semi-colon delimiter in one of the following cases:\nThe tool run by -exec doesn’t accept multiple files as an argument. Running the tool on so many files at once might use up too much memory. We want to start getting some results as soon as possible, even though it’ll take more time to get all the results. One of the commands I use often with is\nfind my_directory/ -type f -exec lfs hsm_restore {} \\; Xargs Command There are commands that only take input as arguments like cp, rm, echo etc. We can use xargs to convert input coming from standard input to arguements.\n$find . -type f -name \u0026#34;*.log\u0026#34; | xargs -n 1 echo rm rm ./log/file5.log rm ./log/file6.log -n 1 argument, xargs turns each line into a command of its own.\n-I option takes a string that gets replaced with the supplied input before the command executes. Commond choices are {} and %.\nfind ./log -type f -name \u0026#34;*.log\u0026#34; | xargs -I % mv % backup/ aws s3 ls --recursive s3://my-bucket/ | grep \u0026#34;my_test\u0026#34; | cut -d\u0026#39; \u0026#39; -f4 | xargs -I{} aws s3 rm s3://my-bucket/{} -P option specify the number of parallel processes used in executing the commands over the input argument list.\nThe command below parallelly encodes a series of wav files to mp3 format: $find . -type f -name \u0026lsquo;*.wav\u0026rsquo; -print0 |xargs -0 -P 3 -n 1 mp3 -V8\nWhen combining find with xargs, it\u0026rsquo;s usually faster than using exec mentioned above.\nrsync command When use the following command, be careful about the relative path. In this command, we\u0026rsquo;re using 16 processes.\nls /my_model/checkpoints/source_dir | xargs -n16 -P -I% rsync -aP % target_dir Here Document/Text Tips and Tricks Sometimes we need to copy multiple files from a directory. In order to copy multiple ones without explicitly listing all the absolute paths, we can use the following way. However, to use the autocomplete, we need to type left { first without the right one. cp /root/local/libs/{a.py, b.py} target_dir Sort and Cut Sometimes we want to sort based on a specific field in string. We can use the following command\n# cut 2nd field, from 2nd field split based on equal sign and sort based on the 3rd field # cut field delimiter is -d, and sort field delimiter is -t echo xxx | grep yyy | cut -d \u0026#34; \u0026#34; -f2 | | sort -t = -k 3 -n | uniq | less How to Split Large PR Sometimes, we have a giant PR which we want to merge. Often times, it gives reviewer a lot of headache. Now we learn how to split large PR into smaller ones. Suppose our feature branch is my_feature_branch, then we can get the diff file using:\nStep 1 git diff master my_feature_branch \u0026gt; ../huge_pr_file Step 2 We switch back to master and create a new feature branch for the first small pr.\ngit checkout master git checkout -b first_small_feature_pr Step 3 Whilst on the first small feature branch, we apply all the code changes.\ngit apply ../huge_pr_file After running this command, we\u0026rsquo;ll see all the unstaged changes on the first_small_feature_pr branch. Now we can stage any files we want, commit and push them.\nStep 4 After pushing/committing the first feature pr, we can stash all the remaining changes (so that we won\u0026rsquo;t commit in this branch).\ngit stash --include-untracked --keep-index Step 5 Repeat this process from above to create a second PR. Based on the dependency or references, we might have to create a new branch based on the other small PR branch.\ngit checkout master git checkout -b second_small_feature_pr #OR git checkout first_small_feature_pr git checkout -b second_small_feature_pr Heredoc In Bash and other shells like Zsh, a Here document (Heredoc) is a type of redirection that allows you to pass multiple lines of input to a command.\nThe syntax of writing HereDoc takes the following form:\n[COMMAND] \u0026lt;\u0026lt;[-] \u0026#39;DELIMITER\u0026#39; HERE-DOCUMENT DELIMITER The first line starts with an optional command followed by the special redirection operator \u0026laquo; and the delimiting identifier. You can use any string as a delimiting identifier, the most commonly used are EOF or END. If the delimiting identifier is unquoted, the shell will substitute all variables, commands and special characters before passing the here-document lines to the command. Appending a minus sign to the redirection operator \u0026laquo;-, will cause all leading tab characters to be ignored. This allows you to use indentation when writing here-documents in shell scripts. Leading whitespace characters are not allowed, only tab. The here-document block can contain strings, variables, commands and any other type of input. The last line ends with the delimiting identifier. White space in front of the delimiter is not allowed. Basic Heredoc Examples In this section, we will look at some basic examples of how to use heredoc.\nHeredoc is most often used in combination with the cat command .\nIn the following example, we are passing two lines of text containing an environment variable and a command to cat using a here document.\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF The current working directory is: $PWD You are logged in as: $(whoami) EOF As you can see from the output below, both the variable and the command output are substituted:\nThe current working directory is: /home/linuxize You are logged in as: linuxize Let’s see what will happen if we enclose the delimiter in single or double quotes.\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;- \u0026#34;EOF\u0026#34; The current working directory is: $PWD You are logged in as: $(whoami) EOF You can notice that when the delimiter is quoted no parameter expansion and command substitution is done by the shell.\nThe current working directory is: $PWD You are logged in as: $(whoami) If you are using a heredoc inside a statement or loop, use the \u0026laquo;- redirection operation that allows you to indent your code.\nif true; then cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;- EOF Line with a leading tab. EOF fi #output Line with a leading tab. Instead of displaying the output on the screen you can redirect it to a file using the \u0026gt;, \u0026raquo; operators.\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF \u0026gt; file.txt The current working directory is: $PWD You are logged in as: $(whoami) EOF If the file.txt doesn’t exist it will be created. When using \u0026gt; the file will be overwritten, while the \u0026raquo; will append the output to the file.\nThe heredoc input can also be piped. In the following example the sed command will replace all instances of the l character with e:\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026#39;EOF\u0026#39; | sed \u0026#39;s/l/e/g\u0026#39; Hello World EOF #output Heeeo Wored To write the piped data to a file:\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u0026#39;EOF\u0026#39; | sed \u0026#39;s/l/e/g\u0026#39; \u0026gt; file.txt Hello World EOF Using Heredoc is one of the most convenient and easiest ways to execute multiple commands on a remote system over SSH .\nWhen using unquoted delimiter make sure you escape all variables, commands and special characters otherwise they will be interpolated locally:\nssh -T user@host.com \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF echo \u0026#34;The current local working directory is: $PWD\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;The current remote working directory is: \\$PWD\u0026#34; EOF #above command output The current local working directory is: /home/linuxize The current remote working directory is: /home/user References [1] https://itsnotbugitsfeature.com/2019/10/22/splitting-a-big-pull-request-into-smaller-review-able-ones/\n","permalink":"https://rich-junwang.github.io/en-us/posts/tech/shell-commands/","summary":"Git Git merge Suppose we\u0026rsquo;re on master branch, if we want to override the changes in the master branch with feature branch, we can use the following command git merge -X theirs feature to keep the master branch changes: git merge -X ours feature If we want to rebase of current branch onto the master, and want to keep feature branch git rebase master -X theirs if we want to keep master branch changes over our feature branch, the git rebase master -X ours To summarize, we can have the following table: \u0026nbsp; Currently on Command \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Strategy \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Outcome \u0026nbsp;master git merge feature \u0026nbsp; -Xtheirs \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Keep changes from feature branch master git merge feature -Xours keep changes from master branch \u0026nbsp;feature git rebase master \u0026nbsp; -Xtheirs \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; Keep changes from feature branch feature git","title":"Shell Commands"},{"content":"Forward and Reverse Proxy Server When clients (web browsers) make requests to sites and services on the Internet, the forward proxy server intercepts those requests and then communicates with servers on behalf of these clients like a middleman.

Multiprocessing is a means to effect parallelism, and it entails spreading tasks over a computer’s central processing units (CPUs, or cores). Multiprocessing is well-suited for CPU-bound tasks: tightly bound for loops and mathematical computations usually fall into this category.\nConcurrency is a slightly broader term than parallelism. It suggests that multiple tasks have the ability to run in an overlapping manner.

One process can contain multiple threads. Python has a complicated relationship with threading thanks to its GIL, but that’s beyond the scope of this article.\nWhat’s important to know about threading is that it’s better for IO-bound tasks. While a CPU-bound task is characterized by the computer’s cores continually working hard from start to finish, an IO-bound job is dominated by a lot of waiting on input/output to complete.\nTo recap the above, concurrency encompasses both multiprocessing (ideal for CPU-bound tasks) and threading (suited for IO-bound tasks). Multiprocessing is a form of parallelism, with parallelism being a specific type (subset) of concurrency. The Python standard library has offered longstanding support for both of these through its multiprocessing, threading, and concurrent.futures packages.\nupdate python on ubuntu When there are multiple version of python in the system, how to set the default python to use.

Most of time, it\u0026rsquo;s related to out of memory (OOM) issue. We can quickly check that using the following command\ndmesg | grep \u0026#34;oom-kill\u0026#34; | less Virtual Env python3 -m pip install \u0026ndash;upgrade pip python3 -m pip install \u0026ndash;user virtualenv python3 -m venv .venv source .venv/bin/activate\nDebug # using pdb import pdb; pdb.set_trace() Exception How to catch generic exception type\ntry: someFunction() except Exception as ex: template = \u0026#34;An exception of type {0} occurred.
