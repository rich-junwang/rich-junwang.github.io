Leaf nodes usually have None for their grad_fn, and only the result nodes have a valid grad_fn, which indicates the type of gradient function. is_leaf Gradient Computation There are two ways to compute grad in Pytorch.\nBackward(): used to compute grad for leaf node. torch.autograd.grad() : Automatic grad computation Backward Let’s first take a look at backward() function. The definition of the backward() function of the torch.autograd is as follows\ntorch.autograd.backward( tensors, grad_tensors=None, retain_graph=None, create_graph=False, grad_variables=None ) Here is the meaning of the parameters here:\ntensor: The tensor used for gradient computation. In other words, these two ways are equivalent: torch.autograd.backward(z) == z.backward(). grad_tensors: Used when computing gradients for matrices. It is also a tensor, and its shape generally needs to match the shape of the preceding tensor. retain_graph: Normally, after calling backward once, PyTorch will automatically destroy the computation graph. So if you want to call backward on a variable multiple times, you need to set this parameter to True. create_graph: When set to True, it allows the computation of higher-order gradients. grad_variables: According to the official documentation, “grad_variables is deprecated. Use grad_tensors instead.” In other words, this parameter will likely be removed in future versions, so just use grad_tensors.\nNote that here t.backward() is equivalent to torch.autograd.backward(t).\nScaler Backward By default, autograd can only compute gradient for a scaler using backward function. For example:\nx = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True) y = torch.tensor(3.0, requires_grad=True) z = x**2+y z.backward() print(z, x.grad, y.grad) # tensor(7., grad_fn=) tensor(4.) tensor(1.) Tensor Backward x = torch.ones(2,requires_grad=True) z = x + 2 z.backward() # raise RuntimeError: grad can be implicitly created only for scalar outputs x = torch.ones(2,requires_grad=True) z = x + 2 z.backward(torch.ones_like(z)) We can sum z here to compute the grad. Or we can use the grad_tensor to multiply with z to compute the tensor.\nAutograd The internal nodes gradient are compute with autograd. Its interface is defined as below:\n# pytorch interface torch.autograd.grad( outputs, inputs, grad_outputs=None, retain_graph=None, create_graph=False, only_inputs=True, allow_unused=False ) We can also compute the gradient for leaf node using autograd. For example,\nimport torch x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True) y = torch.tensor(3.0, requires_grad=True) z = x**2+y z.backward() print(z, x.grad, y.grad) x = torch.tensor(2.0, requires_grad=True) z = x**2 print(torch.autograd.grad(outputs=z, inputs=x), x.grad) Grad_fn and next_functions How the backward computation graph works with grad_fn and next_functions?\nEssentially grad_fn is an objection which\na callable to compute current step gradient with respect to input (such as loss) a pointer to previous compute node grad_fn through next_functions. Think of this as a linked list. # Example from ref 1. torch.manual_seed(6) x = torch.randn(4, 4, requires_grad=True) y = torch.randn(4, 4, requires_grad=True) z = x * y l = z.sum() l.backward() print(x.grad) print(y.grad) # Notice that we have ops (like multiply, sum) and tensors (x, y, z, l) # Forward # x # \\ # multi -\u003e z -\u003e sum -\u003e l # / # y # backward # dx # \\ # back_multi \u003c- dz \u003c- back_sum \u003c- dl # / # dy # equivalent torch.manual_seed(6) x = torch.randn(4, 4, requires_grad=True) y = torch.randn(4, 4, requires_grad=True) z = x * y l = z.sum() dl = torch.tensor(1.) back_sum = l.grad_fn dz = back_sum(dl) back_mul = back_sum.next_functions[0][0] dx, dy = back_mul(dz) back_x = back_mul.next_functions[0][0] back_x(dx) back_y = back_mul.next_functions[1][0] back_y(dy) print(x.grad) print(y.grad) Another example [2]\n# Notice that we have ops (like multiply, sum) and tensors (A, B, C etc) # A # \\ # multi -\u003e C -\u003e exp -\u003e D -\u003e sum -\u003e F # / / # B E A = torch.tensor(2., requires_grad=True) B = torch.tensor(.5, requires_grad=True) E = torch.tensor(1., requires_grad=True) C = A * B D = C.exp() F = D + E # tensor(3.7183, grad_fn=) 打印计算结果，可以看到F的grad_fn指向AddBackward，即产生F的运算 print(F) # [True, True, False, False, True, False] 打印是否为叶节点，由用户创建，且requires_grad设为True的节点为叶节点 print([x.is_leaf for x in [A, B, C, D, E, F]]) # [, , , None] # 每个变量的grad_fn指向产生其算子的backward function，叶节点的grad_fn为空 print([x.grad_fn for x in [F, D, C, A]]) # print ((, 0), (, 0)) # 由于F = D + E， 因此F.grad_fn.next_functions也存在两项，分别对应于D, E两个变量， # 每个元组中的第一项对应于相应变量的grad_fn，第二项指示相应变量是产生其op的第几个输出。 # E作为叶节点，其上没有grad_fn，但有梯度累积函数，即AccumulateGrad（由于反传时多出可能产生梯度，需要进行累加） print(F.grad_fn.next_functions) # 进行梯度反传 F.backward(retain_graph=True) # tensor(1.3591) tensor(5.4366) tensor(1.) 算得每个变量梯度，与求导得到的相符 print(A.grad, B.grad, E.grad) print(C.grad, D.grad) next_functions returns a tuple, each element of which is also a tuple with two elements. The first is the previous grad_fn function we need to call, e.g. back_mul in the example. The second is the argument index of the previous ops in the previous output.\nRegister Hook register_hook function registers a backward hook. The hook will be called every time a gradient with respect to the Tensor is computed. The hook can be registered for both tensor and ops.\nimport torch def print_grad(grad): print(grad) return grad / 2 w = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(2, 2)) w.register_hook(print_grad) loss = (w - 1) ** 2 print('before backward') loss.mean().backward() print('after backward') print(w.grad) def parameter_hook(grad): print('parameter hook') def operator_hook(*grads): print('operator hook' ) w = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.randn(2, 2)) w.register_hook(parameter_hook) print('first') y = w + 1 op1 = y.grad_fn print(op1) op1.register_hook(operator_hook) y.sum().backward() print('second') z = w + 1 op2 = z.grad_fn print(op2) z.sum().backward() model.eval() and torch.no_grad() One last word at eval() and no_grad(). These two are actually unrelated. During inference, both need to be used: model.eval() sets modules like BatchNorm and Dropout to evaluation mode, ensuring the correctness of the inference results, but it does not help save memory. torch.no_grad() declares that no gradients should be calculated, which does save a lot of memory and GPU memory.\nScale Gradient In megablocks lib, there is a piece of code which catches my attention\nclass ScaleGradient(torch.autograd.Function): @staticmethod @torch.amp.autocast_mode.custom_fwd(device_type='cuda') def forward(ctx: Any, x: torch.Tensor, scale: float): ctx.scale = scale return x @staticmethod @torch.amp.autocast_mode.custom_bwd(device_type='cuda') def backward(ctx: torch.Tensor, grad: torch.Tensor): return grad * ctx.scale, None Why we want to scale gradient in such a way instead of scale the loss?\nLet’s take a look at this class. In the forward pass, it simply returns x unchanged. In the backward pass, it multiplies the gradient by scale before propagating it backward. So the value of x remains the same during forward, but its gradient flow is scaled. Essentially it acts as identity operator with a custom gradient.\nWhy not just scale the loss? Scaling the loss (loss * scale) will scale all gradients in the computation graph by that factor, globally.\nBut sometimes we might want to:\nScale gradients for a particular tensor or path, While leaving the rest of the model unchanged. That’s what ScaleGradient enables. We can selectively apply it to certain variables or branches of the computation graph.\nExample:\ny1 = scale_gradient(f(x), 0.5) # Gradients to f(x) scaled down by 0.5 y2 = g(x) # Normal gradient flow loss = y1 + y2 Here, only the gradient flowing through f(x) is scaled. Scaling the whole loss would shrink both y1 and y2 paths, which isn’t what we want.\nReferences https://amsword.medium.com/understanding-pytorchs-autograd-with-grad-fn-and-next-functions-b2c4836daa00 https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/321449610 ","wordCount":"1599","inLanguage":"en-us","datePublished":"2024-03-11T00:18:23+08:00","dateModified":"2024-03-11T00:18:23+08:00","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Jun"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://rich-junwang.github.io/en-us/posts/tech/ml_infra/pytorch/pytorch_autograd/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Jun's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://rich-junwang.github.io/img/Q.gif"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://rich-junwang.github.io/en-us/ accesskey=h title="Jun's Blog (Alt + H)"><img src=https://rich-junwang.github.io/img/Q.gif alt=logo aria-label=logo height=35>Jun's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)">

grad_tensors: Used when computing gradients for matrices. It is also a tensor, and its shape generally needs to match the shape of the preceding tensor.
retain_graph: Normally, after calling backward once, PyTorch will automatically destroy the computation graph. So if you want to call backward on a variable multiple times, you need to set this parameter to True.
create_graph: When set to True, it allows the computation of higher-order gradients.
grad_variables: According to the official documentation, &ldquo;grad_variables is deprecated. Use grad_tensors instead.&rdquo; In other words, this parameter will likely be removed in future versions, so just use grad_tensors.</p></blockquote><p>Note that here <code>t.backward()</code> is equivalent to <code>torch.autograd.backward(t)</code>.</p><h4 id=scaler-backward>Scaler Backward<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#scaler-backward>#</a></h4><p>By default, autograd can only compute gradient for a scaler using <code>backward</code> function.

In the forward pass, it simply returns <code>x</code> unchanged. In the backward pass, it multiplies the gradient by <code>scale</code> before propagating it backward. So the value of <code>x</code> remains the same during forward, but its gradient flow is scaled. Essentially it acts as <strong>identity operator with a custom gradient</strong>.</p><h3 id=why-not-just-scale-the-loss>Why not just scale the loss?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#why-not-just-scale-the-loss>#</a></h3><p>Scaling the loss (<code>loss * scale</code>) will scale <strong>all gradients in the computation graph</strong> by that factor, globally.</p><p>But sometimes we might want to:</p><ul><li><strong>Scale gradients for a particular tensor or path</strong>,</li><li>While leaving the rest of the model unchanged.</li></ul><p>That’s what <code>ScaleGradient</code> enables.
