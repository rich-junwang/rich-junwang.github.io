It removes staged file, but will keeop the local changes there.\ngit reset file_path Git check difference Use the following command to checkout COMMIT (commit hash) ancestor and COMMIT difference\ngit diff COMMIT~ COMMIT git diff HEAD~ HEAD Git rebase resolve conflicts Sometimes when we do git rebase and we have many commits, we have to resolve a lot of conflicts, which can be really frustrating. One quick way might be to squash commits first to have a single commit, then do rebase. Another way is what we describe below.\nFirst, checkout temp branch from feature branch and start a standard merge\ngit checkout -b temp git merge origin/master git commit -m \"Merge branch 'origin/master' into 'temp'\" You will have to resolve conflicts, but only once and only real ones. Then stage all files and finish merge. Then return to your feature branch and start rebase, but with automatically resolving any conflicts.\ngit checkout feature git rebase origin/master -X theirs Branch has been rebased, but project is probably in invalid state. We just need to restore project state, so it will be exact as on branch ’temp’. Technically we just need to copy its tree (folder state) via low-level command git commit-tree. Plus merging into current branch just created commit.\ngit merge --ff $(git commit-tree temp^{tree} -m \"Fix after rebase\" -p HEAD) git branch -D temp More details is here: https://github.com/capslocky/git-rebase-via-merge. Thanks to the original author!\nFind Command The original post is here: https://www.baeldung.com/linux/find-exec-command\n1. Basics The find command is comprised of two main parts, the expression and the action. When we initially use find, we usually start with the expression part. This is the part that allows us to specify a filter that defines which files to select.\nA classic example would be:\n$ find Music/ -name *.mp3 -type f Music/Gustav Mahler/01 - Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde.mp3 Music/Gustav Mahler/02 - Der Einsame im Herbst.mp3 The action part in this example is the default action, -print. This action prints the resulting paths with newline characters in between. It’ll run if no other action is specified.\nIn contrast, the -exec action allows us to execute commands on the resulting paths. Let’s say we want to run the file command on the list of mp3 files we just found to determine their filetype. We can achieve this by running the following command:\n$ find Music/ -name *.mp3 -exec file {} \\; Music/Gustav Mahler/01 - Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde.mp3: Audio file with ID3 version 2.4.0, contains:MPEG ADTS, layer III, v1, 128 kbps, 44.1 kHz, Stereo Let’s dissect the arguments passed to the -exec flag, which include: A command: file A placeholder: {} A command delimiter: ; Now we’ll walk through each of these three parts in-depth.\n2. The Command Any command that can be executed by our shell is acceptable here. We should note that this isn’t our shell executing the command, rather we’re using Linux’s exec directly to execute the command. This means that any shell expansion won’t work here, as we don’t have a shell. Another effect is the unavailability of shell functions or aliases.\nAs a workaround for our missing shell functions, we can export them and call bash -c with our requested function on our file. To see this in action, we’ll continue with our directory of Mahler’s mp3 files. Let’s create a shell function that shows the track name and some details about the quality:\nfunction mp3info() { TRACK_NAME=$(basename \"$1\") FILE_DATA=$(file \"$1\" | awk -F, '{$1=$2=$3=$4=\"\"; print $0 }') echo \"${TRACK_NAME%.mp3} : $FILE_DATA\" } If we try to run the mp3info command on all of our files, -exec will complain that it doesn’t know about mp3info:\nfind . -name \"*.mp3\" -exec mp3info {} \\; find: ‘mp3info’: No such file or directory As mentioned earlier, to fix this, we’ll need to export our shell function and run it as part of a spawned shell:\n$ export -f mp3info $ find . -name \"*.mp3\" -exec bash -c \"mp3info \\\"{}\\\"\" \\; 01 - Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde : 128 kbps 44.1 kHz Stereo 02 - Der Einsame im Herbst : 128 kbps 44.1 kHz Stereo 03 - Von der Jugend : 128 kbps 44.1 kHz Stereo Note that because some of our file names hold spaces, we need to quote the results placeholder.\n3. The Results Placeholder The results placeholder is denoted by two curly braces {}.\nWe can use the placeholder multiple times if necessary:\nfind . -name \"*.mp3\" -exec bash -c \"basename \\\"{}\\\" \u0026\u0026 file \\\"{}\\\" | awk -F: '{\\$1=\\\"\\\"; print \\$0 }'\" \\; 01 - Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde.mp3 Audio file with ID3 version 2.4.0, contains MPEG ADTS, layer III, v1, 128 kbps, 44.1 kHz, Stereo 02 - Der Einsame im Herbst.mp3 Audio file with ID3 version 2.4.0, contains MPEG ADTS, layer III, v1, 128 kbps, 44.1 kHz, Stereo 03 - Von der Jugend.mp3 Audio file with ID3 version 2.4.0, contains MPEG ADTS, layer III, v1, 128 kbps, 44.1 kHz, Stereo In the above example, we ran both the basename, as well as the file commands. To allow us to concatenate the commands, we spawned a separate shell, as explained above.\n4. The Delimiter We need to provide the find command with a delimiter so it’ll know where our -exec arguments stop. Two types of delimiters can be provided to the -exec argument: the semi-colon(;) or the plus sign (+). As we don’t want our shell to interpret the semi-colon, we need to escape it (;).\nThe delimiter determines the way find handles the expression results. If we use the semi-colon (;), the -exec command will be repeated for each result separately. On the other hand, if we use the plus sign (+), all of the expressions’ results will be concatenated and passed as a whole to the -exec command, which will run only once.\nLet’s see the use of the plus sign with another example:\n$ find . -name \"*.mp3\" -exec echo {} + ./Gustav Mahler/01 - Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde.mp3 ./Gustav Mahler/02 - Der Einsame im Herbst.mp3 ./Gustav Mahler/03 - Von der Jugend.mp3 ./Gustav Mahler/04 - Von der Schönheit.mp3 ./Gustav Mahler/05 - Der Trunkene im Frühling.mp3 ./Gustav Mahler/06 - Der Abschied.mp3 When running echo, a newline is generated for every echo call, but since we used the plus-delimiter, only a single echo call was made. Let’s compare this result to the semi-colon version:\n$ find . -name \"*.mp3\" -exec echo {} \\; ./Gustav Mahler/01 - Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde.mp3 ./Gustav Mahler/02 - Der Einsame im Herbst.mp3 From a performance point of view, we usually prefer to use the plus-sign delimiter, as running separate processes for each file can incur a serious penalty in both RAM and processing time.\nHowever, we may prefer using the semi-colon delimiter in one of the following cases:\nThe tool run by -exec doesn’t accept multiple files as an argument. Running the tool on so many files at once might use up too much memory. We want to start getting some results as soon as possible, even though it’ll take more time to get all the results. One of the commands I use often with is\nfind my_directory/ -type f -exec lfs hsm_restore {} \\; Xargs Command There are commands that only take input as arguments like cp, rm, echo etc. We can use xargs to convert input coming from standard input to arguements.\n$find . -type f -name \"*.log\" | xargs -n 1 echo rm rm ./log/file5.log rm ./log/file6.log -n 1 argument, xargs turns each line into a command of its own.\n-I option takes a string that gets replaced with the supplied input before the command executes. Commond choices are {} and %.\nfind ./log -type f -name \"*.log\" | xargs -I % mv % backup/ aws s3 ls --recursive s3://my-bucket/ | grep \"my_test\" | cut -d' ' -f4 | xargs -I{} aws s3 rm s3://my-bucket/{} -P option specify the number of parallel processes used in executing the commands over the input argument list.\nThe command below parallelly encodes a series of wav files to mp3 format: $find . -type f -name ‘*.wav’ -print0 |xargs -0 -P 3 -n 1 mp3 -V8\nWhen combining find with xargs, it’s usually faster than using exec mentioned above.\nExport and Xargs To export each line as an environment variable we can use\nexport $(cat filename | xargs -L 1) rsync command When use the following command, be careful about the relative path. In this command, we’re using 4 processes.\nls /my_model/checkpoints/source_dir | xargs -n1 -P4 -I% rsync -aP % target_dir # the above command may suffer when there is only one folder inside the source dir that is too big. To solve this issue, use the following command. Note the -R here is relative path. cd src_dir \u0026\u0026 find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -P4 -I% rsync -avR % target_dir Tips and Tricks Sometimes we need to copy multiple files from a directory. In order to copy multiple ones without explicitly listing all the absolute paths, we can use the following way. However, to use the autocomplete, we need to type left { first without the right one. cp /root/local/libs/{a.py, b.py} target_dir Sort and Cut Sometimes we want to sort based on a specific field in string. We can use the following command\n# cut 2nd field, from 2nd field split based on equal sign and sort based on the 3rd field # cut field delimiter is -d, and sort field delimiter is -t echo xxx | grep yyy | cut -d \" \" -f2 | | sort -t = -k 3 -n | uniq | less How to Split Large PR Sometimes, we have a giant PR which we want to merge. Often times, it gives reviewer a lot of headache. Now we learn how to split large PR into smaller ones. Suppose our feature branch is my_feature_branch, then we can get the diff file using:\nStep 1 git diff master my_feature_branch \u003e ../huge_pr_file Step 2 We switch back to master and create a new feature branch for the first small pr.\ngit checkout master git checkout -b first_small_feature_pr Step 3 Whilst on the first small feature branch, we apply all the code changes.\ngit apply ../huge_pr_file After running this command, we’ll see all the unstaged changes on the first_small_feature_pr branch. Now we can stage any files we want, commit and push them.\nStep 4 After pushing/committing the first feature pr, we can stash all the remaining changes (so that we won’t commit in this branch).\ngit stash --include-untracked --keep-index Step 5 Repeat this process from above to create a second PR. Based on the dependency or references, we might have to create a new branch based on the other small PR branch.\ngit checkout master git checkout -b second_small_feature_pr #OR git checkout first_small_feature_pr git checkout -b second_small_feature_pr Heredoc In Bash and other shells like Zsh, a Here document (Heredoc) is a type of redirection that allows you to pass multiple lines of input to a command.\nThe syntax of writing HereDoc takes the following form:\n[COMMAND] \u003c\u003c[-] 'DELIMITER' HERE-DOCUMENT DELIMITER The first line starts with an optional command followed by the special redirection operator « and the delimiting identifier. You can use any string as a delimiting identifier, the most commonly used are EOF or END. If the delimiting identifier is unquoted, the shell will substitute all variables, commands and special characters before passing the here-document lines to the command. Appending a minus sign to the redirection operator «-, will cause all leading tab characters to be ignored. This allows you to use indentation when writing here-documents in shell scripts. Leading whitespace characters are not allowed, only tab. The here-document block can contain strings, variables, commands and any other type of input. The last line ends with the delimiting identifier. White space in front of the delimiter is not allowed. Basic Heredoc Examples In this section, we will look at some basic examples of how to use heredoc.\nHeredoc is most often used in combination with the cat command .\nIn the following example, we are passing two lines of text containing an environment variable and a command to cat using a here document.\ncat \u003c\u003c EOF The current working directory is: $PWD You are logged in as: $(whoami) EOF As you can see from the output below, both the variable and the command output are substituted:\nThe current working directory is: /home/linuxize You are logged in as: linuxize Let’s see what will happen if we enclose the delimiter in single or double quotes.\ncat \u003c\u003c- \"EOF\" The current working directory is: $PWD You are logged in as: $(whoami) EOF You can notice that when the delimiter is quoted no parameter expansion and command substitution is done by the shell.\nThe current working directory is: $PWD You are logged in as: $(whoami) If you are using a heredoc inside a statement or loop, use the «- redirection operation that allows you to indent your code.\nif true; then cat \u003c\u003c- EOF Line with a leading tab. EOF fi #output Line with a leading tab. Instead of displaying the output on the screen you can redirect it to a file using the \u003e, » operators.\ncat \u003c\u003c EOF \u003e file.txt The current working directory is: $PWD You are logged in as: $(whoami) EOF If the file.txt doesn’t exist it will be created. When using \u003e the file will be overwritten, while the » will append the output to the file.\nThe heredoc input can also be piped. In the following example the sed command will replace all instances of the l character with e:\ncat \u003c\u003c'EOF' | sed 's/l/e/g' Hello World EOF #output Heeeo Wored To write the piped data to a file:\ncat \u003c\u003c'EOF' | sed 's/l/e/g' \u003e file.txt Hello World EOF Using Heredoc is one of the most convenient and easiest ways to execute multiple commands on a remote system over SSH .\nWhen using unquoted delimiter make sure you escape all variables, commands and special characters otherwise they will be interpolated locally:\nssh -T user@host.com \u003c\u003c EOF echo \"The current local working directory is: $PWD\" echo \"The current remote working directory is: \\$PWD\" EOF #above command output The current local working directory is: /home/linuxize The current remote working directory is: /home/user Another usage is to read strings into a variable. The following is an example where we can read a json format config to my_config_json variable.\nread -r -d '' my_config_json \u003c","wordCount":"3048","inLanguage":"en-us","datePublished":"2018-02-11T00:18:23+08:00","dateModified":"2018-02-11T00:18:23+08:00","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Jun"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://rich-junwang.github.io/en-us/posts/tech/shell-commands/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Jun's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://rich-junwang.github.io/img/Q.gif"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://rich-junwang.github.io/en-us/ accesskey=h title="Jun's Blog (Alt + H)"><img src=https://rich-junwang.github.io/img/Q.gif alt=logo aria-label=logo height=35>Jun's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)">

Thanks to the original author!</p><h3 id=find-command>Find Command<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#find-command>#</a></h3><p>The original post is here: <a href=https://www.baeldung.com/linux/find-exec-command>https://www.baeldung.com/linux/find-exec-command</a></p><h4 id=1-basics>1. Basics<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-basics>#</a></h4><p>The find command is comprised of two main parts, the expression and the action.
When we initially use find, we usually start with the expression part. This is the part that allows us to specify a filter that defines which files to select.</p><p>A classic example would be:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span style=display:flex><span>$ find Music/ -name *.mp3 -type f
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Music/Gustav Mahler/01 - Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde.mp3
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Music/Gustav Mahler/02 - Der Einsame im Herbst.mp3
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The action part in this example is the default action, -print. This action prints the resulting paths with newline characters in between. It’ll run if no other action is specified.</p><p>In contrast, the -exec action allows us to execute commands on the resulting paths.
Let’s say we want to run the file command on the list of mp3 files we just found to determine their filetype. We can achieve this by running the following command:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span style=display:flex><span>$ find Music/ -name *.mp3 -exec file {} \;
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>Music/Gustav Mahler/01 - Das Trinklied vom Jammer der Erde.mp3:
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>  Audio file with ID3 version 2.4.0, contains:MPEG ADTS, layer III, v1, 128 kbps, 44.1 kHz, Stereo
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Let’s dissect the arguments passed to the -exec flag, which include:
A command: file<br>A placeholder: {}<br>A command delimiter: ;<br>Now we’ll walk through each of these three parts in-depth.</p><h4 id=2-the-command>2. The Command<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-the-command>#</a></h4><p>Any command that can be executed by our shell is acceptable here. We should note that this isn’t our shell executing the command, rather we’re using Linux’s exec directly to execute the command. This means that any shell expansion won’t work here, as we don’t have a shell. Another effect is the unavailability of shell functions or aliases.</p><p>As a workaround for our missing shell functions, we can export them and call bash -c with our requested function on our file. To see this in action, we’ll continue with our directory of Mahler’s mp3 files. Let’s create a shell function that shows the track name and some details about the quality:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span style=display:flex><span>function mp3info() {
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>    TRACK_NAME=$(basename &#34;$1&#34;)
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>    FILE_DATA=$(file &#34;$1&#34; | awk -F, &#39;{$1=$2=$3=$4=&#34;&#34;; print $0 }&#39;)
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>    echo &#34;${TRACK_NAME%.mp3} : $FILE_DATA&#34;
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If we try to run the mp3info command on all of our files, -exec will complain that it doesn’t know about mp3info:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span style=display:flex><span>find . -name &#34;*.mp3&#34; -exec mp3info {} \;
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>find: ‘mp3info’: No such file or directory
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As mentioned earlier, to fix this, we’ll need to export our shell function and run it as part of a spawned shell:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-gdscript3 data-lang=gdscript3><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#f92672>$</span> <span style=color:#66d9ef>export</span> <span style=color:#f92672>-</span>f mp3info

To allow us to concatenate the commands, we spawned a separate shell, as explained above.</p><h4 id=4-the-delimiter>4. The Delimiter<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#4-the-delimiter>#</a></h4><p>We need to provide the find command with a delimiter so it’ll know where our -exec arguments stop. Two types of delimiters can be provided to the -exec argument: the semi-colon(;) or the plus sign (+). As we don’t want our shell to interpret the semi-colon, we need to escape it (;).</p><p>The delimiter determines the way find handles the expression results. If we use the semi-colon (;), the -exec command will be repeated for each result separately. On the other hand, if we use the plus sign (+), all of the expressions’ results will be concatenated and passed as a whole to the -exec command, which will run only once.</p><p>Let’s see the use of the plus sign with another example:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span style=display:flex><span>$ find . -name &#34;*.mp3&#34; -exec echo {} +

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When running echo, a newline is generated for every echo call, but since we used the plus-delimiter, only a single echo call was made. Let’s compare this result to the semi-colon version:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span style=display:flex><span>$ find . -name &#34;*.mp3&#34; -exec echo {} \;

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>From a performance point of view, we usually prefer to use the plus-sign delimiter, as running separate processes for each file can incur a serious penalty in both RAM and processing time.</p><p>However, we may prefer using the semi-colon delimiter in one of the following cases:</p><ul><li>The tool run by -exec doesn’t accept multiple files as an argument.</li><li>Running the tool on so many files at once might use up too much memory.</li><li>We want to start getting some results as soon as possible, even though it’ll take more time to get all the results.</li></ul><p>One of the commands I use often with is</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span style=display:flex><span>find my_directory/  -type f -exec lfs hsm_restore {} \;

</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>DELIMITER
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The first line starts with an optional command followed by the special redirection operator &#171; and the delimiting identifier.
You can use any string as a delimiting identifier, the most commonly used are EOF or END.
If the delimiting identifier is unquoted, the shell will substitute all variables, commands and special characters before passing the here-document lines to the command.
Appending a minus sign to the redirection operator &#171;-, will cause all leading tab characters to be ignored. This allows you to use indentation when writing here-documents in shell scripts. Leading whitespace characters are not allowed, only tab.
The here-document block can contain strings, variables, commands and any other type of input.
The last line ends with the delimiting identifier. White space in front of the delimiter is not allowed.
Basic Heredoc Examples
In this section, we will look at some basic examples of how to use heredoc.</p><p>Heredoc is most often used in combination with the cat command .</p><p>In the following example, we are passing two lines of text containing an environment variable and a command to cat using a here document.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-fallback data-lang=fallback><span style=display:flex><span>cat &lt;&lt; EOF
