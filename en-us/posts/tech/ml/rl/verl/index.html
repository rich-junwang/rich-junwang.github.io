RL training can be modeled as a dataflow, where each node represents computation of a neural network (NN) and each edge denotes data dependencies between the NNs. For instance, actor, critic, reward model, reference model, rollout engine each can be seen as a node. The data transfer in-between is the edge. This is an important concept as later when we talk about intra-node computation and inter-node dataflow, the node here refers to theses models, not a physical machine we usually talk about in distributed training setting.
The reason we talk about this is because we have to understand why veRL talks about single-controller and multi-controller system.
Single-controller, simply put, is one process that coordinates all the workflow as opposed to multi-controller is multiple processes each manages its own workflow.
Now it becomes obvious that if we use multi-controller system to coordinate dataflow from rollout model to critic, reward model etc, it could be complicated because it&rsquo;s multi-processes communication. Thus, for the dataflow, we want to have single-controller for inter-node data exchange. On the contrary, for modern model training and model inference, people tend to use single-process-multiple-data (SPMD) approach, which is a multi-controller approach. In the ideal case, if both training engine and rollout engine utilize SPMD, parameter update from training engine to rollout engine can be done in parallel from multiple copies which can greatly increase system robustness. vLLM recently added SPMD inference [2]."><meta name=author content="Jun"><link rel=canonical href=https://rich-junwang.github.io/en-us/posts/tech/ml/rl/verl/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.css rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/assets/js/highlight.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script><link rel=icon href=https://rich-junwang.github.io/img/Q.gif><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://rich-junwang.github.io/img/Q.gif><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://rich-junwang.github.io/img/Q.gif><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://rich-junwang.github.io/img/Q.gif><link rel=mask-icon href=https://rich-junwang.github.io/img/Q.gif><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en-us href=https://rich-junwang.github.io/en-us/posts/tech/ml/rl/verl/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/font-awesome@4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css><script src=//busuanzi.ibruce.info/busuanzi/2.3/busuanzi.pure.mini.js></script><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.3/dist/jquery.min.js></script><script>var _hmt=_hmt||[];(function(){var e,t=document.createElement("script");t.src="",e=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e.parentNode.insertBefore(t,e)})()</script><meta property="og:title" content="veRL"><meta property="og:description" content="Hybrid Controller System

Single-controller, simply put, is one process that coordinates all the workflow as opposed to multi-controller is multiple processes each manages its own workflow.\nNow it becomes obvious that if we use multi-controller system to coordinate dataflow from rollout model to critic, reward model etc, it could be complicated because it’s multi-processes communication. Thus, for the dataflow, we want to have single-controller for inter-node data exchange. On the contrary, for modern model training and model inference, people tend to use single-process-multiple-data (SPMD) approach, which is a multi-controller approach.

There are mainly three steps:\nRollout to get trajectory Collect experience, i.e. inference to generate training data Actor/Critic model training for prompts in dataloader: # Stage 1: rollout (response generation): prefill + decoding step by step rollout = actor.generate_sequences(prompts) # Stage 2: prepare experience: inference # i.e. generating training data values = critic.compute_values(rollout) ref_log_prob = reference.compute_log_prob(rollout) reward = reward.compute_reward(rollout, ref_log_prob) batch = compute_advantages(reward, values) # Stage 3: actor and critic training critic_metrics = critic.update_critic(batch) actor_metrics = actor.update_actor(batch) Hybrid Engine Modern LLM training engine and inference engine gradually diverges. Inferences focuses on leverages customized kernels to minimize latency while training aims to support high precision, large batches and N-D parallelism to maximize throughput. Thus, veRL chooses to have both training engine and rollout/inference engine for actor model.\nGiven that we have actor training engine, rollout engine, critic model, reference model and reward model, it’s critical to optimize GPU allocation and placement of the models. There are generally three placement plans:\nSeparate placement: each model placed on separate devices Group coloate: different group of models can be placed together Actor/Ref colocated on some GPUs Critic/RM colocated on other GPUs All model colocate together (to be continued)\nReferences HybridFlow: A Flexible and Efficient RLHF Framework https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/11400 https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hybrid_flow.html#id9 GSPMD: General and Scalable Parallelization for ML Computation Graphs ","wordCount":"474","inLanguage":"en-us","datePublished":"2024-08-05T00:18:23-07:00","dateModified":"2024-08-05T00:18:23-07:00","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Jun"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://rich-junwang.github.io/en-us/posts/tech/ml/rl/verl/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Jun's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://rich-junwang.github.io/img/Q.gif"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://rich-junwang.github.io/en-us/ accesskey=h title="Jun's Blog (Alt + H)"><img src=https://rich-junwang.github.io/img/Q.gif alt=logo aria-label=logo height=35>Jun's Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)">
