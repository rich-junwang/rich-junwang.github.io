Forward KL and Reverse KL
KL divergence of two distributions $P$ and $Q$ is defined as:

$$
D_{KL}(P \| Q) = \mathbb{E}_{x \sim P}\left[\log \frac{P(X)}{Q(X)}\right]
$$In general knowledge distillation, $P$ is the output of the teacher model and does not have trainable parameters, while $Q$ is the output of the student model and contains parameters that can be optimized.
Because the KL Divergence is not symmetric, thus forward KL is

$$
\arg\min_\theta D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P \| Q_\theta)
$$Reverse KL is

$$
\arg\min_\theta D_{\mathrm{KL}}(Q_\theta \| P)
$$Offline Distillation
The core idea of knowledge distillation is to use the output of a teacher model (typically soft labels, i.e., probability distributions) to guide the training of a student model. Unlike traditional supervised learning, knowledge distillation uses not only the real (hard) labels (namely the original labels in student model training data) but also the soft labels generated by the teacher model to convey more information.

Teacher Evaluation: The teacher assesses each token. If a token is poorly ranked based on the teacher’s distribution, it is replaced with the teacher’s version. Adaptive Training: This process creates high-quality training data that aligns with the student’s inference-time behavior, facilitating better learning.
