Part I

The world is your oyster. It&rsquo;s up to you to find the pearls.
Still a dreamer, yet more of a realist than ever before, I knew this
was my time to sail. On the horizon I saw the shining future, as before. The difference now was that I felt
the wind at my back. I was ready.
The future was uncertain, absolutely, and there were many hurdles,
twists, and turns to come, but as long as I kept moving forward, one foot in front of the other, the voices
of fear and shame, the messages from those who wanted me to believe that I wasn&rsquo;t good enough, would be
stilled.
Others may question your credentials, your papers, your degrees.
Others may look for all kinds of ways to diminish your worth. But what is inside you no one can take from
you or tarnish. This is your worth, who you really are, your degree that can go with you wherever you go,
that you bring with you the moment you come into a room, that can&rsquo;t be manipulated or shaken. Without that
sense of self, no amount of paper, no pedigree, and no credentials can make you legit. No matter what, you
have to feel legit inside first.
Walk that walk and go forward all the time. Don&rsquo;t just talk that
talk, walk it and go forward. Also, the walk didn&rsquo;t have to be long strides; baby steps counted too. Go
forward.
You got a dream&mldr; You gotta protect it. People can&rsquo;t do somethin'
themselves, they wanna tell you you can&rsquo;t do it. If you want somethin&rsquo;, go get it.
Don&rsquo;t worry if your tasks are small and rewards are few, remember
that the mighty oak was once a nut like you.
When you know this world as it is and you still love it, then your
life will be beautiful.
What is a success: To laugh often and much, to win the respect of
intelligent people and the affection of children, to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the
betrayal of false friends, to appreciate beauty, to find the best in others, to leave the world a bit
better&mldr;
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step!
Adversity is a catalyst for greatness!
Winners worry about winning; losers worry about winners
Slow is smooth and smooth is fast
Success is not final, failure is not fatal, it is the courage to continue that counts.
Doublethink, to deliberately believe in lies, while knowing they&rsquo;re false. Examples of this in everyday life: &ldquo;Oh, I need to be pretty to be happy. I need surgery to be pretty. I need to be thin, famous, fashionable.&rdquo; Our young men today are being told that women are whores, bitches, things to be screwed, beaten, shit on, and shamed. This is a marketing holocaust. Twenty-four hours a day for the rest of our lives, the powers that be are hard at work dumbing us to death. So to defend ourselves, and fight against assimilating this dullness into our thought processes, we must learn to read. To stimulate our own imagination, to cultivate our own consciousness, our own belief systems. We all need skills to defend, to preserve our own minds. (Detachment)
Happiness as a byproduct of a well-ordered life may last. As a goal, it is doomed to failure (Gilded Age).

It&rsquo;s up to you to find the pearls.</li><li>Still a dreamer, yet more of a realist than ever before, I knew this
was my time to sail. On the horizon I saw the shining future, as before. The difference now was that I felt
the wind at my back. I was ready.</li><li>The future was uncertain, absolutely, and there were many hurdles,
twists, and turns to come, but as long as I kept moving forward, one foot in front of the other, the voices

Others may look for all kinds of ways to diminish your worth. But what is inside you no one can take from
you or tarnish. This is your worth, who you really are, your degree that can go with you wherever you go,
that you bring with you the moment you come into a room, that can&rsquo;t be manipulated or shaken. Without that
sense of self, no amount of paper, no pedigree, and no credentials can make you legit. No matter what, you
have to feel legit inside first.</li><li>Walk that walk and go forward all the time. Don&rsquo;t just talk that
talk, walk it and go forward. Also, the walk didn&rsquo;t have to be long strides; baby steps counted too. Go
forward.</li><li>You got a dream&mldr; You gotta protect it. People can&rsquo;t do somethin'
themselves, they wanna tell you you can&rsquo;t do it. If you want somethin&rsquo;, go get it.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t worry if your tasks are small and rewards are few, remember
that the mighty oak was once a nut like you.</li><li>When you know this world as it is and you still love it, then your

intelligent people and the affection of children, to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the
betrayal of false friends, to appreciate beauty, to find the best in others, to leave the world a bit

Examples of this in everyday life: &ldquo;Oh, I need to be pretty to be happy. I need surgery to be pretty. I need to be thin, famous, fashionable.&rdquo; Our young men today are being told that women are whores, bitches, things to be screwed, beaten, shit on, and shamed. This is a marketing holocaust. Twenty-four hours a day for the rest of our lives, the powers that be are hard at work dumbing us to death. So to defend ourselves, and fight against assimilating this dullness into our thought processes, we must learn to read. To stimulate our own imagination, to cultivate our own consciousness, our own belief systems. We all need skills to defend, to preserve our own minds.
