      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sama has a very good blog talking about how to manage one&amp;rsquo;s career. I copied it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve observed thousands of founders and thought a lot about what it takes to make a huge amount of money or to create something important. Usually, people start off wanting the former and end up wanting the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are 13 thoughts about how to achieve such outlier success. Everything here is easier to do once you’ve already reached a baseline degree of success (through privilege or effort) and want to put in the work to turn that into outlier success. [1] But much of it applies to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Compound yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compounding is magic. Look for it everywhere. Exponential curves are the key to wealth generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A medium-sized business that grows 50% in value every year becomes huge in a very short amount of time. Few businesses in the world have true network effects and extreme scalability. But with technology, more and more will.  It’s worth a lot of effort to find them and create them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
